Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network built to run on affordable, low-power devices. Seeed Studio provides a comprehensive range of ready-to-go Meshtastic devices for hobbyists and industrial users. XIAO ESP32S3 & Wio-SX1262 Kit is flexible solution for meshtastic developer and maker.

## Flash Firmware

:::note
Please flash the firmware onto your device if you purchased the XIAO ESP32S3 & Wio-SX1262 Kit before **October 24, 2024** by following this step-by-step tutorial.
:::

**Step 1**: Firstly, open a browser and visit https://flasher.meshtastic.org/# requires Chrome or Edge browser.

**Step 2**: Then, use a suitable USB cable to connect the device to the PC. You may need to turn off, then **press and hold the BOOT button** while plugging in the USB cable.

**Step 3**: Follow the following instruction provided to perform the subsequent flashing operations. Select the Device as "**Seeed XIAO S3**", Firmware as **the lastest** one, and then click "**Flash**". Don't forget to tick "**Full Erase and Install**" if you want to cover previous firmware.

## Software Overview

Meshtastic provides multiple platform softwares for users to choose from, including Android app, Apple app, web client. It also provides Python CLI, Linux Native and integration methods for developers to use.

For specific information, please refer to [the official website of Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/).

* [Android App](https://meshtastic.org/docs/category/android-app/): Android application is available on F-Droid repo and Google Play Store. This allows you to connect to your Meshtastic device from your Android phone via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (if on the same network) or USB On-The-Go (OTG).
* [Apple App](https://meshtastic.org/docs/category/apple-apps/): It is available on app store. By default, the Meshtastic app for iOS supports the use of native offline Apple Maps.
* [Web Client](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/web-client/): Meshtastic Web is a Meshtastic client that runs directly in your browser.
* [Python CLI](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli/): The python pip package installs a "meshtastic" command line executable, which displays packets sent over the network as JSON and lets you see serial debugging information from the meshtastic devices.
* [Linux Native](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/linux-native/): The device software can also run on a native Linux machine thanks to the Portduino framework.
* [Meshtastic Integrations](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/integrations/): The Meshtastic ecosystem is highly extensible and allows easy integration with a number of existing software products and projects.


## Device Connection

Before using Meshtastic, the device needs to be connected first. There are two connection methods. The first one is to use an expansion board, and the corresponding information will be displayed on the display. Then, the configuration can be carried out on the corresponding platform according to the reflected information. The second one is to connect the XIAO and the Wio-SX1262 module, and use a serial port tool to obtain the node ID and password. 


### Method 1: Connected to Expansion board

After flashing firmware and downloading Meshtastic app, Expansion board would be a good tool
 for connection and additional application such as adding grove sensors and modules easily.

**Step 1**: Ensure that the device to be connected (such as "device") is turned on and in a discoverable state. And open the Meshtastic app on your mobile phone.

**Step 2**: In the Meshtastic app, there is an "+" icon on bottom right. Click it to let the app start scanning for nearby connectable devices. Then select the corresponding device ID showing on OLED display.

**Step 3**: Once selected correctly, enter the code showing on OLED display. Press the botton to switch display.

**Button Functions:**

* Press once to switch the screen.
* Press twice to broadcast.
* Press three times to switch the GPS mode.

**Step 4**: Set the Lora region, then the device will reboot.

**Step 5**: Finish reboot, the device status can be checked on Meshtastic app and OLED display.

### Method 2: Serial port tool
Select a serial port debugging tool you like. I will take Comtool on mac as an example below. Select the **serial** connection, choose **the corresponding port**, configure the baud rate as **115200**, and turn on **RTS and DTR**. Open the connection and you can see the connection data.
Search for "**nodenum**" to find the corresponding node ID. Its default **password is 123456**.

:::tip
The last four digits of nodenum are the device number ID discovered by the meshtastic app. For example, "nodenum 0x9e20d02c" is "Meshtastic_d02c" in meshtastic.

## Communicate with Wio Tracker T1000-E

**Step 1**. Connect Wio Tracker T1000-E following [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecap_t1000_e/#get-started-1).

**Step 2**. Make sure the following setting is same as your configuration on XIAO ESP32S3 for Meshatastic. 

1. Device activation and setup
- Ensure that both devices are turned on and in normal working condition.
- The wireless communication function of the device (such as Bluetooth, LoRa, etc.) should be enabled. Check the relevant settings to ensure that it is not accidentally turned off or restricted.

2. Distance and signal strength
- The distance between the two devices cannot be too far. After initail testing, the communication distance of XIAO ESP32S3 for Meshtastic with 2 dbm IPEX antenna is over 2.5 km. Generally speaking, in a more open environment, can be over 20 km.

3. Network Settings
- Ensure that the devices are in the same network mode or channel setting. Easily set to same 'lora region' and 'Modem preset' using Meshtastic APP.

**Step 3**. Communicate with Wio Tracker T1000-E

Once connected, you can start sending and receiving messages through the Meshtastic network. Messages can be text-based or may support additional features depending on the capabilities of the devices and the app. You can also monitor the network activity and see which devices are currently connected and active.

## Sensor Connection

In the meshtastic application, the Wio-SX1262 with XIAO esp32s3 kit is capable of supporting a wide range of sensors. When used in conjunction with the XIAO expansion board, it can support numerous grove sensors, please check [here](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/blob/3f1c86f9535279fd17eaaab6e10a06f09915b7e4/src/detect/ScanI2C.h#L10). Additionally, when combined with the GNSS add on module, it forms the smallest module within meshtastic that has GPS functionality.
