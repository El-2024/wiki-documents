## Installation of plug-ins on Home Assistant

Before we begin building our environment detection system, we need to install a few essential add-ons in Home Assistant. These add-ons will provide the necessary functionality and tools to integrate the Grove Vision AI V2 and XIAO ESP32C3 with Home Assistant. The required add-ons are **EMQX**, **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal**, and **Node-RED**. Let's go through the installation process for each add-on.

### Step 1. Installing EMQX

Open your Home Assistant web interface and navigate to the **Settings** menu. Click on the **Add-ons** option to access the add-on management page.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/4.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

In the bottom right corner of the page, click on the **ADD-ON STORE** button to open the add-on store.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/5.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

In the search bar of the add-on store, type **EMQX** and press enter to search for the add-on.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/6.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Locate the **EMQX** add-on in the search results and click on it to view its details. Click on the **INSTALL** button to begin the installation process. Home Assistant will download and install the EMQX add-on. Wait for the installation to complete.

### Step 2. Installing Advanced SSH & Web Terminal

In the Home Assistant "Add-on Store," search for **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/7.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Locate the **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal** add-on and click on it to view its details. Click on the **Install** button to start the installation process. Home Assistant will download and install the Advanced SSH & Web Terminal add-on.

### Step 3. Installing Node-RED

Again, in the Home Assistant "Add-on Store," search for **Node-RED**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/8.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Find the **Node-RED** add-on and click on it to access its details. Click on the "Install" button to initiate the installation process. Allow Home Assistant to download and install the Node-RED add-on.

## Deploying pysscma via Docker on Home Assistant

In this step, we will download and set up the Python SSCMA (Seeed Studio Cross-platform Modular API) server using the Advanced SSH & Web Terminal add-on in Home Assistant. This server will enable communication between the Grove Vision AI V2 and Home Assistant. Follow the detailed steps below:

### Step 4. Accessing the Advanced SSH & Web Terminal

Open your Home Assistant web interface and navigate to the **Settings** menu. Click on the **Add-ons** option to access the add-on management page. Locate the **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal** add-on and click on it to open its details page.

Please turn off the **Protection mode** on this page.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/9.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Click on the **START** button if the add-on is not already running. Once the add-on is running, click on the **OPEN WEB UI** button to access the terminal interface.

:::note
The first time you launch this plugin you may need to fill in `username`, `password` and `authorized_key` on the configuration page of the plugin details page. For detailed configuration information, please read the documentation provided with the plugin.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/10.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>
:::

### Step 5. Downloading the pysscma.tar package

In the Advanced SSH & Web Terminal, navigate to the root directory by executing the following command:

```
cd /
```

Download the **pysscma.tar** package by running the following command:

```
wget -O pysscma.tar https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/pysscma.tar
```

Wait for the download to complete. The **pysscma.tar** package will be saved in the root directory.

### Step 6. Loading the Docker image

After the download is finished, execute the following command to load the Docker image from the pysscma.tar package:

```
docker load -i pysscma.tar
```

Docker will load the image, and you will see the image ID once the process is complete.

To start the Python SSCMA server, run the following command:

```
docker run -itd --net host --name pysscma_server --restart on-failure --privileged python-sscma:latest server --host 0.0.0.0
```

This command will create and start a Docker container named "pysscma_server" with the necessary configurations.

To check if the Docker container is running properly, execute the following command:

```
docker ps
```
You should see the "pysscma_server" container listed with a status of "Up".


### Step 7. Obtaining the IP address

To get the IP address of the Docker container, run the following command:

```
ifconfig | grep docker -A 10
```

Look for the "inet" field in the output, and note down the IP address associated with it (e.g., 172.30.232.1).

This IP address will be used in the subsequent steps to configure the communication between the Grove Vision AI V2.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/1.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Configure MQTT Broker

In this step, we will configure the EMQX add-on in Home Assistant to set up user authentication for secure communication between the Grove Vision AI V2 and Home Assistant.

### Step 8. Creating a Built-in Database and User

Open your Home Assistant web interface and navigate to the "Settings" menu. Click on the "Add-ons" option to access the add-on management page. Locate the "EMQX" add-on and click on it to open its details page. Click on the "START" button if the add-on is not already running. Once the add-on is running, click on the "OPEN WEB UI" button to access the EMQX Dashboard.

In the EMQX Dashboard login page, enter the default username and password.

- Default username: **admin**
- Default password: **public**

Click on the "Login" button to access the EMQX Dashboard.

In the EMQX Dashboard, navigate to the **Authentication** section from the left sidebar menu. Click on the **Databases** tab.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/11.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Click on the **Create** button. In the **Mechanism** dropdown, select **Password-Based**, In the **Backend** dropdown, select **Built-in Database**. Click on the "Create" button to create the Built-in Database.

After creating the Built-in Database, click on the **Users** tab in the "Authentication" section. Click on the "Add User" button.

- In the "Username" field, enter "seeed".
- In the "Password" field, enter "seeed".

Go back to the "Databases" tab in the "Authentication" section. Locate the previously created database in the list of databases.

Click on the toggle switch next to the database to enable it. The database status should change to "Enabled".

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/12.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 9. Configure the network for Grove Vision AI V2

Connect the Grove Vision AI V2 to your computer and open the [Model Assistant's configuration page](https://seeed-studio.github.io/SenseCraft-Web-Toolkit/#/setup/config).

After clicking on the top right corner to connect to Grove Vision AI V2, please turn on the MQTT button and enter the following information that you need to fill in the page.

- **SSID & Password**: The device needs to be on the same LAN as the host where the Home Asistant is installed. So please configure the network under the same LAN. XIAO only supports 2.4G WiFi, 5G network is not available.
- **Encryption**: Select **AUTO**.
- **Host**: IP address of the host where Home Assistant is installed.
- **Port**: `1883`.
- **clientId**: For the device identification number, please prefix it with `grove_vision_ai_v2_` followed by the custom ID number.
- **username**: The name of the EMQX database you just create.
- **password**: The password of the EMQX database you just create.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/13.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then click the Save button below. After saving, it **does not mean that Grove Vision AI V2 has been written correctly**, please go back to **Process** in the left menu bar and check if the IP address of the device has appeared and if the status of the MQTT connection is correct.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/visionai-v2-ha/33.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::caution
When IP Address is displayed, it means there is no problem with WIFI, and Service status must be the text in the figure to represent normal, note that if WIFI is not normal, MQTT is definitely not normal; when you just switch over, it may show unconnected, and you need to wait for about 10s or so, you don't need to refresh to see the status, and it will show the newest status after the change of the status automatically.
:::

If the connection is working, you can theoretically see the data stream in EMQX.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/3.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::note
Since the Node-RED connections have not been configured yet, you should see only one All Connections on EMQX.
:::

## Configure Node-RED

In this step, we will configure the Node-RED add-on in Home Assistant to create the necessary flows for integrating the Grove Vision AI V2 with Home Assistant.

### Step 10. Configure and run Node-RED

Open your Home Assistant web interface and navigate to the "Settings" menu. Click on the "Add-ons" option to access the add-on management page. Locate the "Node-RED" add-on and click on it to open its details page. Click on the "Configuration" tab.

In the Node-RED configuration, locate the **ssl** option. Disable **ssl** option. Click on the **SAVE** button to apply the configuration changes.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/14.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Click on the "START" button to start the Node-RED add-on. Wait for the add-on to start successfully. You can check the logs to monitor the progress. Once the Node-RED add-on is running, click on the "OPEN WEB UI" button to access the Node-RED Editor.

### Step 11. Installing the `msg-speed` node

In the Node-RED Editor, click on the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner. Select **Manage palette** from the menu.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/15.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

In the **Palette** sidebar, click on the **Install** tab. In the search box, type **msg-speed** and press Enter. Locate the **msg-speed** node in the search results and click on the **Install** button next to it. Wait for the installation to complete, then close the "Palette" sidebar.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/16.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 12. Importing the Flow JSON

Please download our prepared JSON file `crowd_density.json` for Flow.

<div class="get_one_now_container" style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <a class="get_one_now_item" href="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/crowd_density.json">
            <strong><span><font color={'FFFFFF'} size={"4"}>Download the file</font></span></strong>
    </a>
</div>

In the Node-RED Editor, click on the hamburger menu again. Select "Import" from the menu. In the "Import nodes" dialog, click on the "select a file to import" button. Browse and select the provided JSON file that contains the pre-configured Node-RED flow. Click on the "Import" button to import the flow into Node-RED.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/17.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then you can see our prepared Node-RED Flow.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/18.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 13. Configuring the MQTT Broker node

In the imported flow, locate the **mqtt-broker** node. Double-click on the node to open its configuration.

In the "Server" field, enter the IP address of the EMQX broker (e.g., localhost or the IP address of the Home Assistant instance).

In the "Username" field, enter the username you created in the EMQX Database (e.g., "seeed").

In the "Password" field, enter the password you set for the user in the EMQX Database (e.g., "seeed"). Click on the "Done" button to save the MQTT broker configuration.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/19.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 14. Verifying the POST node URL

In the imported flow, locate the "POST" node. Double-click on the node to open its configuration.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/20.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Verify that the "URL" field contains the correct IP address of the pysscma Docker container that you obtained in **[Step 7](#step-7-obtaining-the-ip-address)**. If necessary, update the URL to match the pysscma Docker IP address. Click on the "Done" button to save the POST node configuration.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/21.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 15. Deploying the Flow

Click on the **Deploy** button in the top-right corner of the Node-RED Editor to deploy the flow. The flow should now be active and ready to handle data from the Grove Vision AI V2.

## Crowd Density Dashboard Setup

In this step, we will access the Node-RED dashboard to monitor and interact with the data from the Grove Vision AI V2 device.

Open a web browser on your computer or mobile device. In the address bar, enter the URL in the following format:

```
http://homeassistant:1880/endpoint/ui/
```

You can now monitor the data flow and interact with the nodes in the Node-RED dashboard.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/vision_ai_v2_heatmap/22.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

First of all, please enter your clientId in the upper left corner. then click the **REFRESH** button and start invoke. Then the Grove Vision AI V2 footage is pushed streaming in real time. You can enable or disable the following functions according to your actual needs.

- **region**: Enabling this function starts the Cross-Area Counting function. By default, when this function is turned on, the image will be divided into two areas, area A and area B, along the orange line in the middle. When an identification frame travels from area a across the orange line to area b, then the **COUNT (A to B)** on the left side of the centre is increased by 1. Conversely, the **COUNT (B to A)** on the right side is increased by 1.

  - **pos1**: This is used to set the position of the left (upper) endpoint of the line segment that divides the area.

  - **pos2**: This is used to set the position of the right (lower) endpoint of the line segment that divides the area.

  - **vertical**: By default, the line segment dividing the area is the horizontal line. When this button is turned on, the line segments become vertical lines.

- **box**: By default, the recognition box is closed. When the button is turned on, the recognition box is displayed in real time in the centre screen.

- **track**: By default, the functionality of Target Tracking is turned off. If the feature is turned on, then the route taken by the recognised object is plotted as a thin green line in the middle image.

- **label**: By default, the recognition label is closed. When the button is turned on, the recognition label is displayed in real time in the centre screen.

- **heatmap**: By default, Target Heatmap is off. When the button is turned on, the crowd density of the currently detected area is displayed. the redder the colour of an area, the more historical occurrences of monitored objects are detected in that area, and the bluer the less.

**Performance** on the far right is the real-time frame rate, Image is the frame rate of the screen transfer, and Overlay is the frame rate of the screen with various functions turned on.

The screen in the centre shows the live preview screen with the various functions turned on, and the small window on the right shows the original screen.

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: What models does this project support?

Currently the project only supports models for target recognition, i.e., the class of models with recognition frames, and does not support, for example, models such as Human Pose Detection and Hand Pose Detection.

### Q2: Why is the dashboard unresponsive after I have turned on the buttons for certain functions?

As this page is built on Node-RED, the page may not refresh in real time in some cases due to browser kernel optimisation. You can try refreshing the screen by clicking the REFRESH button and the invoke button, or refreshing the current web page.
