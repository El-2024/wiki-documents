1.  Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes** and click **CREATE AUTOMATION**.
2.  For the **Trigger**, select `Device` and find your IoT Button.
3.  ZHA exposes the clicks as device actions. Select the desired trigger from the list, for example:
    -   `"remote_button_short_press"`
    -   `"remote_button_double_press"`
    -   `"remote_button_long_press"`
4.  Configure the **Action** you want to perform.
5.  Save the automation.

Example automation in Home Assistant YAML to toggle a light with a **double click**:

```yaml
alias: IoT Button Double Click - Toggle Living Room Light
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: device
    domain: zha
    device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID_HERE # Replace with your button's device ID
    type: "remote_button_double_press" # The exact type may vary, select it from the UI
action:
  - service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
mode: single
```

## Advanced Usage: Switching Firmware

One of the key features of the IoT Button is its flexibility. You can switch between ESPHome and Zigbee firmware on **either V1 or V2 hardware**.

- (Not recommended) **To switch to ESPHome**: If your button is running Zigbee firmware and you want to use Wi-Fi, simply follow the flashing instructions in **Method 1, Step 2** to install the ESPHome firmware.

- **To switch to Zigbee**: If your button is running ESPHome and you want to join a Zigbee network, you will need to compile and flash the [Zigbee firmware using Arduino IDE](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/seeed_iot_button_with_zigbee/). After flashing, follow the pairing steps in **Method 2**.
