# Getting Started with Bus Servo Driver Board / XIAO Bus Servo Adapter

This wiki covers two related products: the **Bus Servo Driver Board** and the **XIAO Bus Servo Adapter**.

- The **Bus Servo Driver Board** does **not** include an onboard XIAO ESP32-C3 microcontroller, nor does it come with a 3D-printed enclosure. It is designed to function as a general-purpose bus servo interface board, allowing you to connect and control servos via an external controller of your choice.

- The **XIAO Bus Servo Adapter**, on the other hand, **includes** the XIAO ESP32-C3 as the main controller and comes with a 3D-printed case. With this version, you can directly control bus servos using the onboard XIAO, making it a more integrated and ready-to-use solution for robotics projects.

Please refer to the rest of this guide for details on setup and usage for both products.

## Introduction

The Bus Servo Driver Board / XIAO Bus Servo Adapter is a compact and powerful hardware solution from Seeed Studio, designed to drive serial bus servos for robotics and automation projects. With support for UART communication, it enables precise control and feedback from multiple ST/SC series servos, including the Feetech SCS series (see [Feetech SCS/STS/TTL Series Official Website](https://www.feetechrc.com/en/scs_ttl_Servo.html)). This makes it ideal for applications such as robotic arms, hexapods, humanoid robots, and wheeled robots requiring servo angle and load feedback.

This guide focuses on the hardware setup, physical connections, key specifications, and **critical jumper settings** to help users integrate the board into their projects effectively.

:::warning Safety Warning

Always disconnect power before connecting or disconnecting servos or wiring. Ensure the input voltage matches the servo requirements to avoid damage.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/bus_servo_driver_board/2.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The Bus Servo Driver Board features several key connection points:

**Input:**

* **DC IN (5.5 * 2.1mm):** This is the power input for the board and the connected servos. Connect a 5~12V power supply here. *Crucially, the voltage of this power supply must match the voltage requirements of your servos.* For example, ST series servos typically operate at 9V, while SC series servos may require 12V.

**Output:**

* **Servo Interface:** This dedicated port is where you connect your ST/SC series bus servos. Ensure the connector is properly aligned.

**Control Interface:**

* **UART (RX/TX):** These pins provide serial communication for controlling the servos. The connection method and jumper settings depend on your host device. See below for details.

## Getting Started

### Selecting the operating mode of the driver board **(Only for Bus Servo Driver Board)**

:::tip
For XIAO Bus Servo Adapter, you don't need to modify any circuits to use the included XIAO ESP32-C3 to control the servos, you can skip this part directly.
:::

The Bus Servo Driver Board offers two primary connection methods: direct UART connection and USB connection via a USB-to-UART adapter. *The correct jumper setting is essential for proper operation.*

#### UART Connection (for MCUs, XIAO, ESP32, etc.)

This method is used when connecting directly to the UART pins of a microcontroller (MCU) like an ESP32, Arduino, Seeed Studio XIAO, or a single-board computer.

* **Wiring:**
    * Connect the `RX` pin on the Driver Board to the `TX` pin (D7) on your host device.
    * Connect the `TX` pin on the Driver Board to the `RX` pin (D6) on your host device.
    * For devices like the Seeed Studio XIAO, you can directly plug the XIAO into the provided headers, ensuring correct pin alignment. This eliminates the need for separate Dupont wires for the UART connection.

* **Jumper Setting (Critical):** 

    * Use a 2.54mm jumper cap to short-circuit the 2pin pin on the front of the board. (It's shorted by default)
    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/bus_servo_driver_board/change-2.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

* **Powering the Host:** Your host device (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero, ESP32, XIAO) will require its own separate power supply.

#### USB Connection

This method is used when connecting to a computer or single-board computer with a USB port (e.g., a PC or Raspberry Pi 4B). You simply connect the control board to the computer using a USB cable.

* **Wiring:**
    * Simply connect the control board to your computer using a USB cable.

* **Jumper Setting (Critical):** 

    * **Step 1.** Locate the soldering jumper on the back of the board. **For USB communication, you must ensure that the two pads are connected (there is a solder bridge between them).**

    - Backside pads for version 1:

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/bus_servo_driver_board/7.jpg" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

    - Backside pads for version 2:

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/bus_servo_driver_board/change-1.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

    * **Step 2.** Use a 2.54mm jumper cap to short-circuit the 2pin pin on the front of the board. (It's shorted by default)
    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/bus_servo_driver_board/change-2.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Required Components (Before You Start)

Before connecting anything, ensure you have the following:

* **Bus Servo Driver Board / XIAO Bus Servo Adapter**
* **Compatible ST/SC series bus servos**: see [Feetech SCS/STS/TTL Series Official Website](https://www.feetechrc.com/en/scs_ttl_Servo.html).
* **5~12V Power Supply:** A battery or power adapter. *The voltage must match your servo's specifications.*
* **Host Device:**
    * **For Direct UART:** A UART-capable device like a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, or Seeed Studio XIAO.
    * **For USB:** A computer (PC, Mac, Linux) or a single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi 4B, *plus* a USB-to-UART adapter.

:::note
For XIAO Bus Servo Adapter, XIAO ESP32-C3 is built-in, so there is no need to prepare a host device.
:::

* **Connecting Wires/Adapters:** Jumper wires (Dupont wires) if using direct UART (except when using XIAO with direct header connection). A USB-to-UART adapter if using the USB connection method.

:::caution
If using SC series servos, confirm the power supply matches their voltage requirements. The board‚Äôs DC input label is tailored for ST series servos but supports SC series voltages as well. **Incorrect jumper settings will prevent communication with the driver board.**

## Controlling Servos via USB

This section describes how to control multiple bus servos through the Bus Servo Driver Board using a USB connection.

### Principle Overview

The Bus Servo Driver Board works by receiving serial (UART) commands from your host device (such as a PC, Raspberry Pi, or microcontroller) via USB. These commands are then relayed to the connected bus servos. By sending the appropriate serial protocol commands, you can control the position, speed, and other parameters of each servo individually.

The board itself does not interpret or generate servo control signals autonomously; instead, it acts as a transparent bridge between your host and the servos. This means you are responsible for sending the correct command packets according to your servo's communication protocol.

### Example Reference

For a practical example of how to send commands to Feetech (ST/SC/STS/TTL series) bus servos, you can refer to the following Python example:  
[lerobot/common/robot_devices/motors/feetech.py on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/common/robot_devices/motors/feetech.py)

This example demonstrates how to construct and send serial packets to control Feetech servos. You can adapt the code to your own host platform and programming language as needed.

> **Note:**  
> - The specific command format and protocol may vary depending on your servo model.  
> - Please consult your servo's official documentation for the correct serial protocol and command structure.  
> - You will need to write or adapt a driver program that matches your servo's requirements.

For more details on the Feetech SCS/STS/TTL series protocol, see the [Feetech official documentation](https://www.feetechrc.com/en/scs_ttl_Servo.html).

## Controlling Servos via XIAO

Next, we describe how to send signals to control servo motion through XIAO and how to use the library.

      }

      Pos[i] += 1024;
      if (Pos[i] > 4095) Pos[i] = 4095;
    }
  }

  st.SyncWritePosEx(ID, Servo_Num, Pos, Speed, ACC);
  delay(600);
}
```

This example demonstrates how to control multiple Feetech SCS series bus servos using the XIAO and the SCServo library. The code initializes two servos, calibrates them, and allows the user to adjust their positions interactively via serial commands. When you send 'j' or 'k' through the serial monitor, the code will decrease or increase the angle of all connected servos, respectively. The current position of each servo is tracked and updated accordingly, and the new positions are sent to the servos using the `SyncWritePosEx` function.

How to customize for your own project:

- **Number of Servos**: Change the value of `Servo_Num` and update the ID, Speed, ACC, and Pos arrays to match the number and IDs of your servos.
Servo IDs: Modify the ID array to match the IDs of your connected servos.

- **Speed and Acceleration**: Adjust the Speed and ACC arrays to set different speeds and accelerations for each servo.

- **Serial Pins**: If you use different pins for UART, update S_RXD and S_TXD definitions.

- **Movement Logic**: You can change the logic in the `loop()` function to implement more complex or project-specific behaviors, such as responding to different serial commands, adding sensor feedback, or integrating with other hardware.

- **Initial Position**: Set the initial values in the `Pos` array to define the starting positions of your servos.
