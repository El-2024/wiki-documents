### Custom Enclosure Design Recommendations

If youâ€™re designing your own enclosure, here are some important guidelines to ensure optimal audio performance:

* Ensure that the distance between the speaker and the two microphones is uniform, and minimize the transmission of speaker vibrations to the microphones to maintain audio clarity.

* The enclosure should allow human voice to reach each microphone without obstruction, ensuring direct sound (as opposed to reflected sound) can evenly reach both microphones for accurate sound capture.

* If you are designing a sealed microphone chamber, avoid creating a resonant cavity that is narrow at both ends and wide in the middle, as this can interfere with front-end signal processing. If a sealed chamber is not feasible, incorporate multiple perforations in the enclosure to prevent sound reflections from bouncing inside before reaching the microphones. This helps to maintain signal integrity.
