## Connect to the LoraWAN¬Æ
LoRaWAN¬Æ (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power, long-range communications between IoT (Internet of Things) devices and gateways. It uses unlicensed radio spectrum in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band, typically at 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in the United States. LoRaWAN¬Æ provides a low-cost, energy-efficient solution for connecting IoT devices over long distances. The technology allows for bi-directional communication between devices and gateways, and it supports a range of data rates to accommodate different types of applications. 

## How to Select Gateway and LoraWAN¬Æ
LoRaWAN¬Æ network coverage is required when using sensors, there are two options.

## How to use the Sensor
In addition to connecting directly to a computer to view real-time detection data, you can also transmit these data through LoraWAN¬Æ and finally upload them to the [SenseCAP cloud platform](https://sensecap.seeed.cc/) or a third-party cloud platform. On the SenseCAP cloud platform, you can view the data in a cycle and display it graphically through your mobile phone or computer. The SenseCAP cloud platform and SenseCAP Mate App use the same account system.

Since our focus here is on describing the model training process, we won't go into the details of the cloud platform data display. But if you're interested, you can always visit the SenseCAP cloud platform to try adding devices and viewing data. It's a great way to get a better understanding of the platform's capabilities!

## FAQ

**What are the ideal camera settings for image capture?**

- For a 5-megapixel camera, it is recommended to capture images within a range of 1m to 5m to achieve optimal image quality. During image capture, ensure that the camera is directly facing the subject, with sufficient lighting (no glare or overexposure), and avoid significant motion or vibration.

**How far can the SenseCAP Vision AI camera detect objects and achieve good results?**

- Based on our testing with a human detection model, the camera can achieve a 70% confidence level for results within a range of 1m to 5m.

**Is it possible to replace the camera or have a customized version of the SenseCAP Vision AI sensor?**

- Yes, if you have a large-volume requirement, please contact us at iot@seeed.cc.
