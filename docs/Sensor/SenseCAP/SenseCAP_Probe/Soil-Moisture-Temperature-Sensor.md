## Product Description

Soil moisture is the water stored in the soil. Too much moisture in the soil is not only bad for the plants but also wastes water and adds extra burdens to our planet earth. Soil temperature is the warmth of the soil. Plants grow best at their preferred temperature ranges. With access to soil moisture and temperature data, we can take actions to make sure the right amount of water is irrigated at the appropriate time, and the plants are in optimal environments which are good for their growth.

This Soil Moisture & Temperature Sensor MODBUS-RTU RS485 (S-Soil MT-02A) is designed with industry standards. It incorporates two sensors (soil moistures sensor and soil temperature sensor) into one, featuring high precision and high sensitivity. By measuring the dielectric constant of the soil, it can stably measure the soil VWC (volumetric water content) regardless of various soil types. The measurement conforms to current international standards for soil moisture measurement.

This soil sensor is IP68 rated, very robust and durable, suitable to be applied at long-term monitoring of soil moisture and temperature at scientific experiments, water-saving irrigation, greenhouses, outdoor farming, gardening, precision agriculture, and other professional environmental monitoring scenarios.
