## Step 2. Add a device by scanning the code using the iPhone Home APP

In the section on adding devices, we'll take Apple's device as an example (since that's all I have on hand). If you have [Google's device](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12391458?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) or [Amazon's device](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/matter) on hand, maybe you can use them as well.

If, as in this article, you want to add devices using the Home APP for iPhone, you need to have an Apple device as a home hub. The devices currently supported by Home Hub are HomePod and Apple TV, read the [Apple website for more details](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/102557). For the purpose of this tutorial, it is assumed that you have already added the Home Hub in the Home APP.

Home APP is installed by default on iOS devices. If you have ever deleted it, you can [search for it](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/home/id1110145103?l=en-GB) again in the App Store and download it.

Open the Home App on your iPhone. Tap the **+** button in the top right corner of the screen. Select **Add or Scan Accessory** from the menu. Use your iPhone camera to scan the QR code provided with the XIAO ESP32C3 . The Home App will recognize the Matter Accessory and display it as a new accessory. Tap **Add to Home** to add the XIAO ESP32C3 to your Home App. Please refer to the detailed operation pictures below.

<div class="table-center">
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <th>Page 1</th>
      <th>Page 2</th>
      <th>Page 3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/24.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/25.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/26.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Page 4</th>
      <th>Page 5</th>
      <th>Page 6</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/27.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/28.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/32.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Page 7</th>
      <th>Page 8</th>
      <th>Page 9</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/29.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
      <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/31.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

## Step 3. Using the XIAO in the Home APP

In the Home App, locate the newly added XIAO ESP32C3 accessory. Tap on the accessory to access its controls. Use the brightness slider to adjust the brightness of the connected lights. Tap on the color icon to change the color of the lights. You can choose from a variety of predefined colors or use the color picker to create custom colors. The lights connected to the XIAO ESP32C3 will respond in real-time to the adjustments made in the Home App.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/30.png" style={{width:300, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Congratulations! You have successfully flashed the light firmware onto the XIAO ESP32C3 board using ESPLaunchPad and paired it with your iPhone's Home App. You can now control the brightness and color of the connected lights directly from your iPhone, creating a personalized and convenient lighting experience.

Feel free to explore more advanced features and customization options available in the Home App and experiment with different light accessories compatible with the XIAO ESP32C3 board. With this foundation, you can further expand your smart home setup and create a truly connected and automated living space.

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: Failed to connect to the device for a long time in Home APP

If you fail to connect to the device for an extended period of time, make sure you see the log message after uploading the firmware. If you have not paired the device for a long time at this point, the XIAO may go into standby mode, at which point you will need to press the Reset button on the XIAO or use Reset Device on the ESPLaunchPad to reboot the device. After that try adding it again.

Apart from that, there could be network issues. Please make sure that XIAO and your iPhone are under the same LAN. And they both need to be connected to a 2.4GHz network, no 5GHz network. After the configuration is done, the phone can use other networks. But XIAO only supports 2.4GHz network.
