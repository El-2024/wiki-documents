## Prepare the Hardware

In this section, we will detail how to configure the use of ESP-IDF in Ubuntu's environment and execute the lighting example provided by ESP-IDF. So for this article, you only need to prepare any of the following XIAO ESP32 series.

<div class="table-center">
	<table align="center">

				</a>
			</div></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

In addition to the XIAO, we also need the WS281x model light bar or light bead. Currently the light example provided by Espressif only supports a single bead, so whether you use a strip or a bead, it will only light up one light. We would also recommend that you pick up Grove Base for XIAO for ease of wiring.

<div class="table-center">
	<table align="center">

## Installation ESP-Matter Step by Step

:::tip
Before starting the environment installation for Matter, make sure you have [installed and accessed the ESP-IDF programming environment](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_idf/#step-5-set-up-environment-variables).
:::

### Step 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the required packages using `apt-get`. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ pkg-config libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev \
     libglib2.0-dev libavahi-client-dev ninja-build python3-venv python3-dev \
     python3-pip unzip libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev libreadline-dev
```

This command installs various packages like `git`, compilers (`gcc`, `g++`), and libraries needed for building and running the Matter SDK.

### Step 2. Clone the ESP-Matter Repository

Clone the `esp-matter` repository from GitHub using the `git clone` command with a depth of 1 to fetch only the latest snapshot:

```bash
cd ~/esp
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter.git
```

Change into the `esp-matter` directory and initialize the required Git submodules:

```bash
cd esp-matter
git submodule update --init --depth 1
```

Navigate to the `connectedhomeip` directory and run a Python script to manage submodules for specific platforms:

```bash
cd ./connectedhomeip/connectedhomeip
./scripts/checkout_submodules.py --platform esp32 linux --shallow
```

This script updates submodules for both ESP32 and Linux platforms in a shallow manner (latest commit only).

### Step 3. Install ESP-Matter

Return to the `esp-matter` root directory, then run the installation script:

```bash
cd ../..
./install.sh
```

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/1.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This script will install additional dependencies specific to the ESP-Matter SDK.

### Step 4. Set Environment Variables

Source the `export.sh` script to set up the environment variables needed for development:

```bash
source ./export.sh
```

This command configures your shell with necessary environment paths and variables.

### Step 5 (Optional). Quick access to the ESP-Matter development environment

To add the provided aliases and environment variable settings to your `.bashrc` file, follow these steps. This will configure your shell environment to easily switch between IDF and Matter development setups, and enable ccache for faster builds.

Open your terminal and use a text editor to open the `.bashrc` file located in your home directory. You can use `nano` or any editor you prefer. For example:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Scroll to the bottom of the `.bashrc` file and add the following lines:

```bash
# Alias for setting up the ESP-Matter environment
alias get_matter='. ~/esp/esp-matter/export.sh'

# Enable ccache to speed up compilation
alias set_cache='export IDF_CCACHE_ENABLE=1'
```

After adding the lines, save the file and exit the text editor.  If you're using `nano`, you can save by pressing `Ctrl+O`, hit `Enter` to confirm, and then `Ctrl+X` to exit.

For the changes to take effect, you need to reload the `.bashrc` file. You can do this by sourcing the `.bashrc` file or closing and reopening your terminal. To source the `.bashrc` file, use the following command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can run `get_matter` and `set_cache` to set up or refresh the esp-matter environment in any terminal session.

```bash
get_matter
set_cache
```

## Running the light Example

Once the Matter environment is configured, we can compile and upload the sample application light to check it out.

### Step 1. Configure the parameters of the project

Navigate to the `examples/light` directory.

```bash
cd examples/light                # Navigate to the light example directory
```

Perform a clean operation to remove previous build files.

```bash
rm -rf build/                     # Clean previous build files
```

Set the target to ESP32-C6.

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32c6        # Set the build target to ESP32-C6
```

Enter the configuration menu and make the necessary configurations.

```bash
idf.py menuconfig                # Enter the configuration menu
```

Within `menuconfig`, you need to locate and enable the `Channel for console oputput` option. Typically, this option can be found under **Component config** -> **ESP System Settings**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/7.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

1. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the option.
2. Press Space or Enter to select the option: `USB Serial/JTAG Controller`.

For a different XIAO, we also need to update its GPIO pin number. This option can be found under **Component config -> Board Support Package (generic) -> LEDs**.

- For XIAO ESP32C3, the GPIO of D9 is 9.
- For XIAO ESP32S3, the GPIO of D9 is 8.
- For XIAO ESP32C6, the GPIO of D9 is 20.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/33.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

1. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the option.
2. Press Space or Enter to enter GPIO number.
3. After enabling the necessary options, exit `menuconfig` by pressing `q` and then press `y`.

### Step 2. Compile and upload the sample application

Continue with the build and flash process:

```bash
idf.py build                      # Build the project
```

If the compilation goes well, you will see the following result.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/2.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then you can upload the programme.

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor  # Flash the firmware and monitor the output
```

Please replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the actual USB device file that corresponds to your XIAO ESP32 if it's different.

Remember to follow all instructions carefully, and make sure that each step completes successfully before moving on to the next. If you encounter any errors, they'll need to be resolved before you can proceed.


:::tip
During the process of flashing Matter's firmware, you may encounter a situation where you don't have permissions, at this time you can use the following command to give permissions to the device's ports and re-upload the programme again. As the device is plugged in or rebooted, permissions may all need to be given again.

```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0       # Grant permissions to the USB device file
```

Please replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the actual USB device file that corresponds to your XIAO ESP32 if it's different.
:::

Then congratulations, if you have successfully flashed the firmware, then in the monitor you will see the debug log output in the terminal.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/3.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Next, we are going to learn how to use the matter command and chip-tool to configure the Matter device in order to complete the debugging and checking of the Matter device.

## Host control and equipment commissioning

We set Channel for `console oputput to USB Serial` in `menuconfig`, the purpose is that we can use the USB interface to control the XIAO, configure to join the network or do other debugging. This step is crucial and determines whether or not we can use the serial tool to issue commands to the device.

These are commands that are connected via a cable to directly control a device, usually starting with `matter`.

### Common commands

- BLE commands: Start and stop BLE advertisement:

	```
	matter ble [start|stop|state]
	```

- Wi-Fi commands: Set and get the Wi-Fi mode:

	```
	matter wifi mode [disable|ap|sta]
	```

- Device configuration: Dump the device static configuration:
	```
	matter config
	```

- Factory reset:

	```
	matter device factoryreset
	```

- On-boarding codes: Dump the on-boarding pairing code payloads:

	```
	matter onboardingcodes
	```

- Get attribute: (The IDs are in hex):

	```
	matter esp attribute get <endpoint_id> <cluster_id> <attribute_id>
	```

	- Example: on_off::on_off:

		```
		matter esp attribute get 0x1 0x6 0x0
		```

- Set attribute: (The IDs are in hex):

	```
	matter esp attribute set <endpoint_id> <cluster_id> <attribute_id> <attribute value>
	```

	- Example: on_off::on_off:

		```
		matter esp attribute set 0x1 0x6 0x0 1
		```

- Diagnostics:

	```
	matter esp diagnostics mem-dump
	```

- Wi-Fi

	```
	matter esp wifi connect <ssid> <password>
	```

### Usage

#### Step 1. Install Minicom

Minicom is a text-based modem control and terminal emulation program for Unix-like operating systems. By installing Minicom, we can easily send Matter control commands to XIAO. To install Minicom on Ubuntu, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install minicom
```

This command updates your package list and installs Minicom.

#### Step 2. Configure User Permissions

To allow non-root users to access serial ports like `ttyACM0`, you need to add your user to the `dialout` group. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
Replace `$USER` with your username or omit it to apply to the current logged-in user. After running this command, you **must log out and log back in** for the group change to take effect.

#### Step 3. Setup Minicom

Now you need to configure Minicom to use the `ttyACM0` port. Run Minicom in setup mode with the following command:

```bash
sudo minicom -s
```

In the setup menu, follow these steps:

1. Select **Serial port setup**.
2. Press 'A' to change the Serial Device to `/dev/ttyACM0`.
3. Adjust other settings as necessary. The default settings are usually 9600 8N1 (9600 Baud, No Parity, 8 Data Bits, 1 Stop Bit). We just need to change the baud rate to **115200**.
4. Press 'Enter' to exit this screen.

#### Step 4. Save Configuration

After setting up the serial port:

1. Select **Save setup as dfl** to make this the default configuration.
2. Exit Minicom setup by selecting **Exit from Minicom**.

#### Step 5: Run Minicom

To start Minicom with the default settings, just type:

```bash
minicom
```

If you need to run it with sudo privileges (e.g., if you encounter permission issues), you can use:

```bash
sudo minicom
```

To exit Minicom, press `Ctrl-A` then press `Z` to bring up the help menu, and then press `X` to exit the program.

#### Step 6. Setting up the XIAO distribution network

Use the following command to get XIAO connected to your network. When selecting a network, you should note that XIAO only supports 2.4G networks, not 5G networks.

```
matter esp wifi connect <ssid> <password>
```

After successful mating, you can use the following commands to query very important information about the Matter device: **VendorID**, **ProductId**, **Discriminator**, and **PinCode**. This information helps you pair devices for use when debugging with the Chip-tool tool.

```
matter config
```

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/8.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Finally, use the following command to dump the on-boarding pairing code payloads.

```
matter onboardingcodes onnetwork
```

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/9.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The last thing shown here is the link to the device's pairing QR code. With the QR code, you can scan the code on your mobile phone to bind the Matter device just like the [Getting Started](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_matter/#step-2-add-a-device-by-scanning-the-code-using-the-iphone-home-app) steps.


## Remote debugging of Matter devices using Chip-tool

Matter devices are an important part of the smart home, and it's impractical to use data cables all the time for debugging and setup. Among Matter debugging tools, the most commonly used is Chip-tool, which helps us to remotely debug our devices when they are connected.

Chip-tool commands usually require a Chip-tool script, so they usually start with `chip-tool`.

### Pair a device over IP

The command below will discover devices and try to pair with the first one it discovers using the provided setup code:

```
chip-tool pairing onnetwork ${NODE_ID_TO_ASSIGN} 20202021
```

The command below will discover devices with long discriminator 3840 and try to pair with the first one it discovers using the provided setup code:

```
chip-tool pairing onnetwork-long ${NODE_ID_TO_ASSIGN} 20202021 3840
```

The command below will discover devices based on the given QR code (which devices log when they start up) and try to pair with the first one it discovers.

```
chip-tool pairing code ${NODE_ID_TO_ASSIGN} MT:#######
```

In all these cases, the device will be assigned node id `${NODE_ID_TO_ASSIGN}` (which must be a decimal number or a 0x-prefixed hex number).

### Forget the currently-commissioned device

```
chip-tool pairing unpair
```

### Using the Client to Send Matter Commands

To use the Client to send Matter commands, run the built executable and pass it the target cluster name, the target command name as well as an endpoint id.

The endpoint id must be between 1 and 240.

```
chip-tool onoff on 1
```

The client will send a single command packet and then exit.

### Usage

When you are ready to debug with Chip-tool, you can disconnect the XIAO from the computer and connect it to a powered source.

As a first step, we need to match the device, which can be done by using any of the methods in the [Pair a device over IP](#pair-a-device-over-ip) section above.

For example, I use the following command.

```
chip-tool pairing onnetwork-long 0x12 20202021 3840
```

In this cases, the device will be assigned node id `0x12` (which must be a decimal number or a 0x-prefixed hex number). 20202021 is PinCode and 3840 is Discriminator.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/5.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Finally, verify that you can control switching the lights on and off with the following command.

Turn on the light:

```
chip-tool onoff on 0x12 0x1
```

Turn off the light:

```
chip-tool onoff off 0x12 0x1
```

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiaoc6-matter/6.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>


0x12 is the node ID assigned to the device when we match.

Congratulations to everyone, the tutorial steps carried out here, I believe you have a preliminary understanding of the general steps of the development framework of ESP-Matter and the use of debugging tools. If there is still something you do not understand or are not familiar with, we will continue to use and guide you in the following tutorials, so stay tuned!

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: Why do I get all kinds of errors during the installation of the environment?

ESP-Matter's environment is a bit more demanding, and if you are using an Ubuntu host that is often used for development, it is likely that errors will occur due to different versions of some Python dependencies. Since the Matter framework is not developed by Seeed, there is probably nothing we can do about this part of the problem, so we recommend that you submit an issue to the official **[ESP-Matter repository](https://github.com/espressif/esp-matter)** for help if you encounter problems with the installation.

### Q2: How do I uninstall Matter's environment?

If you are running `./install.sh` script and get stuck in the step of configuring your Python environment, then you may need to check that your [version](#prepare-the-software) of Matter matches the version of connectedhomeip.

The simple way to reset it, is to execute the following command.

```
rm -r connectedhomeip/connectedhomeip/.environment
```

Then re-pull the appropriate version of the connectedhomeip branch again.

```
git submodule update --init --depth 1
```

If it still doesn't work, delete the entire esp-matter folder and re-run it again following the contents of the Wiki.
