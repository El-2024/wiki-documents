# XIAO ESP32-C3 iBeacon with BME680 Sensor Using ESP-IDF

In this tutorial, we'll build a low-power temperature monitoring system that broadcasts environmental data using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in iBeacon format. We'll use the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3, the XIAO expansion board, and a Grove BME680 environmental sensor. This project demonstrates how to build robust embedded applications using ESP-IDF‚ÄîEspressif's official development framework.

## Overview

Our system will:

1. Read temperature, humidity and pressure from the BME680 sensor
2. Package this data into BLE advertisement packets
3. Periodically wake up, take measurements, advertise data, and go back to sleep to conserve battery power

### System Flowchart

- USB Type-C cable
- Computer with ESP-IDF installed

## Software Requirements

- [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/index.html) (v5.0 or later)
- Git
- [Project GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Priyanshu0901/xiao_ibeacon)

## Step 1: Hardware Setup

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/2.webp" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

1. **Connect the BME680 sensor to the XIAO Expansion Board**:

   - Connect the Grove BME680 sensor to one of the I2C ports on the XIAO Expansion Board.
   - The sensor communicates via I2C, so any I2C-compatible Grove port will work.

2. **Mount the XIAO ESP32-C3 on the expansion board**:

   - Carefully align and insert the XIAO ESP32-C3 module onto the expansion board.
   - Ensure the pins are properly aligned and the module is securely seated.

3. **Connect to your computer**:
   - Use a USB Type-C cable to connect the XIAO expansion board to your computer.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install ESP-IDF**:
   Follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/index.html) for your operating system.

   For Linux, you can use:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/esp
   cd ~/esp
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
   cd esp-idf
   ./install.sh
   . ./export.sh
   ```

2. **Clone the project repository**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Priyanshu0901/xiao_ibeacon.git
   cd xiao_ibeacon
   ```

   :::caution
   The `--recurse-submodules` flag is critical as the project relies on external libraries included as Git submodules. Without this, compilation will fail.

   If you've already cloned without submodules, run:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

   :::

## Step 3: Project Structure and Understanding the Components

The project consists of three main components:

1. **BME680 Sensor Component (`sensor_t_a_h`)**:

   - Handles communication with the BME680 sensor
   - Manages sensor initialization, reading, and data processing
   - Provides temperature, humidity, and pressure data

2. **BLE Beacon Component (`ble_beacon`)**:

   - Configures the BLE stack
   - Creates and broadcasts BLE advertisements with sensor data
   - Manages BLE initialization and cleanup

3. **Power Management Component (`power_manager`)**:
   - Handles deep sleep functionality
   - Manages power-efficient operation
   - Controls wake-up sources and sleep duration

### Component Interaction

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/3.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This diagram shows how the different software components interact with the hardware elements of the system.

## Step 4: Understanding the Configuration

Before building, let's understand the key configurations:

1. **Main Application Settings** (in `main.c`):

   - `ADV_TIME_MS`: Duration for BLE advertising (500ms)
   - `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`: How often to poll the sensor (150ms)
   - `TIMEOUT_MS`: Maximum time to wait for sensor readings (2000ms)
   - `SLEEP_TIME_MS`: How long to sleep between measurements (~29.3 seconds)

2. **Sensor Configuration** (in `components/sensor_t_a_h/Kconfig`):

   ```
   menu "BME68X Configuration"
       config BME68X_I2C_ADDR
           hex "BME68X I2C Address"
           default 0x76
           help
               I2C address of the BME68X sensor. Default is 0x76.
               Use 0x77 if SDO pin is pulled high.

       choice BME68X_INTERFACE
           prompt "BME68X Interface"
           default BME68X_USE_I2C
           help
               Select the interface to use with BME68X sensor.

           config BME68X_USE_I2C
               bool "I2C Interface"

           config BME68X_USE_SPI
               bool "SPI Interface"
       endchoice

       if BME68X_USE_I2C
           config BME68X_I2C_PORT
               int "I2C Port Number"
               range 0 1
               default 0
               help
                   I2C port number for BME68X.

           config BME68X_I2C_SDA_PIN
               int "I2C SDA GPIO"
               range 0 48
               default 12
               help
                   GPIO pin for I2C SDA.

           config BME68X_I2C_SCL_PIN
               int "I2C SCL GPIO"
               range 0 48
               default 13
               help
                   GPIO pin for I2C SCL.

           config BME68X_I2C_CLOCK_SPEED
               int "I2C Clock Frequency (Hz)"
               range 100000 400000
               default 100000
               help
                   I2C clock frequency for BME68X. Standard mode (100 KHz) or Fast mode (400 KHz).
       endif
   endmenu
   ```

3. **BLE Configuration** (in `components/ble_beacon/common.h`):
   The BLE device name is defined in the `common.h` file:

   ```c
   #define DEVICE_NAME "Xiao_TempSensor"
   ```

### Modifying Configuration Parameters

#### Using ESP-IDF's menuconfig Tool

The ESP-IDF framework provides a powerful configuration tool called **menuconfig** which offers a text-based UI for modifying project settings. This tool is based on Kconfig, the same configuration system used by the Linux kernel.

To launch the configuration interface:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

This will display a text-based UI with configuration categories:

```
    Application Configuration  --->
    ESP-IDF Components         --->
    SDK tool configuration     --->
    Compiler options          --->
    Component config          --->
    Bootloader config         --->
    Serial flasher config     --->
```

**Navigation in menuconfig:**

- Use `‚Üë` and `‚Üì` arrows to navigate
- Press `Enter` to enter a submenu
- Press `Esc` to go back
- Press `Space` to toggle options
- Press `Y` for 'Yes' and `N` for 'No' on boolean options
- Press `?` for help on the currently selected option
- Press `Q` or `Esc` multiple times to exit, then `Y` to save changes

**Finding Sensor Configuration:**

   - Configure debug log levels and output destinations

After making your changes, press `Q` to exit and `Y` to save changes. Then rebuild the project with:

```bash
idf.py build
```

#### Changing the BLE Device Name

To change the BLE device name, you need to modify the `DEVICE_NAME` macro in `components/ble_beacon/common.h`:

1. Open the file:

   ```bash
   nano components/ble_beacon/common.h
   ```

2. Find the `DEVICE_NAME` definition and change it to your desired name:

   ```c
   #define DEVICE_NAME "MyCustomSensor"
   ```

3. Save the file and rebuild the project.

## Step 5: Building and Flashing the Project

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/xiao_ibeacon
   ```

2. **Configure the project**:

   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32c3
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```

   Navigate through the menu to check or adjust settings:

   ```

   Note: Your port might be different (Windows: COM3, COM4, etc.)

5. **Monitor the output** (optional):

   ```bash
   idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor
   ```

   Press Ctrl+] to exit the monitor.

## Step 6: Testing the iBeacon

1. **Download a BLE Scanner app** on your smartphone:

   - iOS: "LightBlue" or "nRF Connect"
   - Android: "nRF Connect" or "BLE Scanner"

2. **Open the app and scan for BLE devices**:

   - Look for a device named "Xiao_TempSensor"
   - Select the device to view its advertisement data

3. **Understand the Advertisement Data**:
   The BLE advertisement contains:

   - Temperature (in degrees Celsius, scaled by 100)
   - Humidity (in percent)
   - Pressure (in hPa, scaled by 10)

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The device wakes up approximately every 30 seconds
   - It takes readings from the BME680 sensor
   - It broadcasts this data for 500ms
   - It then enters deep sleep to conserve power

### Python Test Scripts

The project includes Python scripts to help test and validate the BLE beacon functionality. Let's explore them:

#### Setting Up the Python Environment

1. Navigate to the test scripts directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/xiao_ibeacon/test_scripts
   ```

2. Run the setup script to create and configure a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   chmod +x setup_venv.sh
   ./setup_venv.sh

   # On Windows
   setup_venv.bat
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

The setup script will install the required packages:

- `bleak`: For BLE communication
- `colorama`: For colored terminal output

#### Using the BLE Scanner Script

The BLE scanner script (`ble_beacon_scanner.py`) scans for BLE advertisements and displays sensor data from our beacon.

Key features of the scanner:

- Looks for a device named "Xiao_TempSensor"
- Decodes the manufacturer-specific data to extract temperature, humidity, and pressure
- Displays values in a formatted terminal UI
- Continuously updates as new advertisements are received

To run the scanner:

```bash
python ble_beacon_scanner.py
```

The script will display a nicely formatted output with the latest sensor readings:

```

```

If you enable debug mode in the script by setting `DEBUG_MODE = True`, you'll see additional information about the BLE advertisements and data parsing.

#### Beacon Data Format

The beacon transmits data in a compressed format to fit within BLE advertisement limitations:

1. Company ID: 0x02E5 (Espressif Systems)
2. Temperature: 16-bit signed integer, scaled by 100 (divide by 100 to get ¬∞C)
3. Humidity: 8-bit unsigned integer (direct percentage value)
4. Pressure: 16-bit unsigned integer, scaled by 10 (divide by 10 to get hPa)

The Python script decodes this format and displays the actual values.

#### Flow of the Test Process

## Step 7: How It Works - Deep Dive

### Sensor Initialization and Reading

The BME680 sensor is initialized with the following steps:

1. **I2C Configuration**: Sets up I2C communication on the appropriate pins (for XIAO ESP32-C3 with the expansion board, GPIO6/GPIO7 for SDA/SCL)
2. **Sensor Initialization**: Configures the BME680 sensor with settings for temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas measurements
3. **Reading Process**: Initiates a measurement and waits for data to be ready
4. **Data Processing**: Converts raw sensor values to human-readable measurements

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/5.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### BLE Advertisement

The BLE functionality operates as follows:

1. **BLE Stack Initialization**: Sets up the ESP32's BLE stack
2. **Advertisement Configuration**: Configures advertisement parameters (interval, data format)
3. **Data Packaging**: Takes sensor readings and packages them into manufacturer-specific data
4. **Advertisement Start/Stop**: Controls the advertisement timing

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/6.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Power Management

The power management system uses the ESP32-C3's built-in sleep capabilities:

1. **Deep Sleep Configuration**: Uses ESP-IDF's sleep API (`esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup()`) to configure the wake-up timer
2. **Wake-up Source**: Sets up timer as the only wake-up source (the system will wake after a specified duration)
3. **Sleep Entry**: Safely shuts down active peripherals before entering deep sleep with `esp_deep_sleep_start()`
4. **Wake-up Process**: When timer expires, the system performs a reset and restarts the application from the beginning

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/7.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The power management component (`power_manager.c`) provides a simple interface for handling sleep modes:

```c
// Initialize power manager
power_manager_init();

// Later, when it's time to sleep:
power_manager_enter_deep_sleep(30000); // Sleep for 30 seconds
```

When the device enters deep sleep, power consumption drops dramatically (to around 10-20 ŒºA), allowing long battery life. The device completely shuts down and will reboot when the timer expires, so any state that needs to be preserved must be stored in RTC memory or non-volatile storage.

### Power Consumption Profile

#### Power Profiling Setup

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/8.webp" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

#### Power Profiles

The system has distinct power usage phases as shown in the power profile below:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/9.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

**Power Phases:**

1. **Sleep Phase**: ~150ŒºA in deep sleep mode (ESP32-C3 RTC controller active + bme680 sleep)
2. **Wake & Initialize**: ~40mA during startup and sensor initialization
3. **Active BLE Advertising**: ~16mA peak during BLE transmission
4. **Cleanup & Sleep Entry**: ~5mA during resource cleanup before sleep entry

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao-c3-ibeacon/10.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

**Battery Life Calculation:**

- Average current in deep sleep (28 secs): 150ŒºA
- Average current during active phase (2 secs): ~40mA
- Effective average current: 3.92‚ÄØmA (measured over 1 minute)
- With a typical 1500‚ÄØmAh Li-Ion battery:
  - 1500‚ÄØmAh √∑ 3.92‚ÄØmA ‚âà 382 hours ‚âà 15.9 days

**Power Optimization Tips:**

- Reduce advertising time to minimize high-current periods
- Use lowest feasible advertising power
- Disable unused peripherals
- Optimize sensor reading process
- Consider extending sleep duration

## Step 8: Customizing the Project

You can customize various aspects of the project:

1. **Change the Sleep Duration**:

   - Edit `SLEEP_TIME_MS` in `main.c` to adjust how often readings are taken

2. **Modify Sensor Settings**:

   - Use `idf.py menuconfig` to change sensor sampling rates, filters, etc.

3. **Adjust BLE Parameters**:

   - Change the device name or advertisement interval in the BLE beacon component

4. **Add Additional Sensors**:
   - Extend the sensor component to include other Grove sensors

### Adding Your Own Sensor

To integrate a different sensor into this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Sensor Component**:

   ```bash
   # Create component directory structure
   mkdir -p components/my_new_sensor/include
   touch components/my_new_sensor/CMakeLists.txt
   touch components/my_new_sensor/Kconfig
   touch components/my_new_sensor/my_new_sensor.c
   touch components/my_new_sensor/include/my_new_sensor.h
   ```

2. **Implement the Component Interface**:

   - Define initialization function
   - Create data reading functions
   - Set up any necessary configuration

   Example header file (`my_new_sensor.h`):

   ```c
   #pragma once
   #include <stdbool.h>
   #include "esp_err.h"

   typedef struct {
       float value1;
       float value2;
       // Additional sensor values
   } my_sensor_data_t;

   /**
    * @brief Initialize the sensor
    * @return ESP_OK on success
    */
   esp_err_t my_sensor_init(void);

   /**
    * @brief Read data from the sensor
    * @param data Pointer to structure to store readings
    * @return ESP_OK on success
    */
   esp_err_t my_sensor_read(my_sensor_data_t *data);
   ```

3. **Configure Build System**:
   Example `CMakeLists.txt`:

   ```cmake
   idf_component_register(
       SRCS "my_new_sensor.c"
       INCLUDE_DIRS "include"
       REQUIRES driver
   )
   ```

4. **Update Main Application**:

   - Add your component to the main application's dependencies
   - Initialize your sensor in the main application flow
   - Include your sensor's readings in the BLE advertisement data

   Example integration in `main.c`:

   ```c
   #include "my_new_sensor.h"

   void app_main(void) {
       // Initialize other components
       // ...

       // Initialize your new sensor
       ESP_ERROR_CHECK(my_new_sensor_init());

       // Read from your sensor
       my_sensor_data_t sensor_data;
       ESP_ERROR_CHECK(my_sensor_read(&sensor_data));

       // Modify BLE data to include your sensor readings
       // ...
   }
   ```

5. **Extend BLE Advertising Data**:

   - Update the BLE beacon component to include your sensor data in advertisements
   - Assign appropriate data type IDs for your new measurements

6. **Update Configuration**:
   - Add Kconfig options for your sensor in `components/my_new_sensor/Kconfig`
   - This allows users to configure your sensor through menuconfig

By following this structured approach, you can seamlessly integrate additional sensors while maintaining the project's modular architecture.

## Troubleshooting

### Important Tips

:::tip
**No Serial Output During Normal Operation**  
For optimal power efficiency, the device doesn't output debug information through the serial port during normal operation. The LED will also not flash when the device is in deep sleep mode. This is intentional to minimize power consumption.

**Reflashing the Device**  
To reflash the device:

1. Press the reset button on the XIAO board when you start the flash process
2. Time your flash command to coincide with the brief active period (when the device is not in deep sleep)
3. Alternatively, hold the reset button, start the flash command, and release the reset button when the flash begins

**Re-enabling Debug Output for Development**  
When developing your own modules or debugging, you can re-enable serial output:

1. Run `idf.py menuconfig`
2. Navigate to `Component config` ‚Üí `Log output`
3. Set the default log level to `INFO` or `DEBUG`
4. Configure the log output destination as `UART0`
5. Remember to disable verbose logging again before deploying to preserve battery life

### Sensor Not Detected

If you encounter issues with sensor detection:

1. **Check Connections**:

   - Ensure the Grove cable is properly connected to both the sensor and the expansion board
   - Verify you're using an I2C Grove port

2. **I2C Address Issues**:

   - The default I2C address for BME680 is 0x76. Some modules might use 0x77.
   - Edit the I2C address in the configuration if needed

3. **Power Issues**:
   - Ensure the XIAO is getting enough power
   - Try a different USB cable or port

### BLE Not Advertising

If BLE advertisements aren't detected:

1. **Check BLE Scanner App**:

   - Try a different BLE scanner app
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone

2. **Monitor Debug Output**:

   - Use `idf.py monitor` to check for error messages

3. **Advertising Duration**:
   - The default setting only advertises for 500ms. If you miss it, increase `ADV_TIME_MS` in `main.c`

### Build or Flash Failures

If you encounter build or flash issues:

1. **ESP-IDF Version**:

   - Ensure you're using ESP-IDF v5.0 or newer
   - Run `. $IDF_PATH/export.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `%IDF_PATH%\export.bat` (Windows) before commands

2. **USB Connection**:

   - Verify the USB connection is stable
   - Try pressing the reset button on the XIAO expansion board before flashing

3. **Port Issues**:
   - Identify the correct port with `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux/macOS) or Device Manager (Windows)
   - Use the `-p` flag with the correct port

## Conclusion

You've now built a power-efficient environmental monitoring system that uses BLE to broadcast temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality data. This project demonstrates several important concepts:

1. **Sensor Integration**: Working with I2C sensors in ESP-IDF
2. **BLE Communication**: Creating and managing BLE advertisements
3. **Power Management**: Implementing deep sleep for battery-efficient operation
4. **ESP-IDF Development**: Using Espressif's official framework for ESP32 development
