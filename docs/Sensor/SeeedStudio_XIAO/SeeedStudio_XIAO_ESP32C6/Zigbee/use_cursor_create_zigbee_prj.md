After installing Cursor, follow these steps to set it up:

1. Launch Cursor
2. Sign in with your account or create a new one
3. Verify that the Chat panel is accessible (usually on the right side of the interface)

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/1.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Opening the Zigbee Examples

When using Cursor to generate code for your project, providing example code can significantly enhance the accuracy of the generated project. Examples serve as a reference point for Cursor, allowing it to understand the structure, syntax, and specific requirements of your project. By analyzing these examples, Cursor can generate more precise and relevant code, tailored to your needs.

In the context of our Zigbee project, finding the right example helps Cursor to:
- Understand the specific functionalities required
- Identify the appropriate libraries and functions to use
- Generate code that is compatible with the hardware and interfaces you are using

By providing a relevant example, you ensure that the generated code is more likely to work correctly and meet your project's requirements, saving you time and effort in debugging and modifications.

Now, let's locate and open the Zigbee examples provided by the ESP32 Arduino package:

1. First, make sure you have installed the **latest ESP32 board package** in Arduino IDE:
  - Open Arduino IDE
  - Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**
  - Search for **esp32**
  - Find **esp32 by Espressif Systems**
  - Click **Install** or **Update** to get the latest version
  - Wait for the installation to complete

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/3.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

2. Navigate to the Zigbee examples directory:

The following paths use ESP32 board package version 3.1.3 as an example. Replace `3.1.3` with your installed version number if different:
   
- On Windows: 

```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\3.1.3\libraries\Zigbee\
```

- On macOS:
```
/Users/[YourUsername]/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/3.1.3/libraries/Zigbee/
```

3. Open Cursor and select **Open Folder** from the File menu.

4. Navigate to the Zigbee directory path from step 2 and click **Open**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/4.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>


## Selecting the Right Example

Before using Cursor's Chat to generate your code, you need to identify the most appropriate example to use as a starting point:

### Determining Your Device Type

Zigbee devices generally fall into two main categories, and understanding this is crucial for selecting the right example code:

1. **Sensors**:
   - Sensors are devices that "sense" the environment and collect data
   - They convert physical information from the real world into electronic signals
   - Sensors only "read" data and then transmit it to the network

   - **Examples**:
     - Temperature sensors: measure the surrounding temperature
     - Humidity sensors: measure moisture levels in the air
     - Light sensors: detect ambient light intensity
     - Motion sensors: detect if objects are moving nearby
     - Gas sensors: detect concentrations of specific gases

2. **Actuators**:
   - Actuators are devices that "perform actions"
   - They receive commands and affect the physical world
   - Actuators are responsible for "changing" the state of something

   - **Examples**:
     - Light switches: turn lights on or off
     - Motor controllers: control motor rotation
     - Relays: control high-power electrical devices
     - Valve controllers: control water or air flow
     - Door locks: lock or unlock doors

**How to determine your device type**:

- If your device primarily collects data (reads information), it's a sensor
- If your device primarily performs actions (changes states), it's an actuator
- Some devices might have both functionalities, in which case you should choose based on the primary function

In our example, the DHT11 is a typical sensor because it reads temperature and humidity data but doesn't change the environment.

### Identifying Interface Type

Next, determine the interface type your sensor uses:

- **GPIO**: Simple digital or analog pins
- **I2C**: Two-wire interface for communication
- **SPI**: Serial Peripheral Interface
- **UART**: Serial communication

The DHT11 uses a simple GPIO interface with a single data line.

### Checking Zigbee Device Support

Before proceeding, it's important to verify if your intended device type is supported by the ESP Zigbee SDK. You can check the supported device types in:

- [ESP Zigbee Device Types](https://github.com/espressif/esp-zigbee-sdk/blob/main/components/esp-zigbee-lib/include/esp_zigbee_type.h)

This header file contains all the device types currently supported by ESP's Zigbee implementation. Review this file to:

1. Confirm your device type is supported
2. Note the specific device ID and cluster IDs you'll need
3. Understand what capabilities are available for your device type

If your device type isn't listed, you may need to:
- Choose a similar supported device type that matches your needs
- Consider implementing a custom device type (advanced)
- Contact ESP support for guidance


### Finding the Closest Example

Browse through the examples in the Zigbee library and find one that most closely matches your needs. For our DHT11 sensor, look for examples like:

- `ZigbeeTemperatureSensor`
- `ZigbeeHumiditySensor`
- Any example that demonstrates reading from a GPIO sensor

Fortunately, ESP provides a "Zigbee_Temp_Hum_Sensor_Sleepy" example in their Zigbee examples, which perfectly matches our needs for creating a temperature and humidity sensor project. This example demonstrates:

- How to implement a temperature and humidity sensor device
- How to configure the device as a sleepy end device to save power
- How to report sensor readings periodically
- How to handle Zigbee networking and data transmission

You can find this example at:
`zigbee/example/Zigbee_Temp_Hum_Sensor_Sleepy`

This example will serve as an excellent starting point for our DHT11-based Zigbee sensor project.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/5.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>


## Determining Pin Connections

For the XIAO ESP32C6 and DHT11 sensor, we need to decide which pins to use:

1. The DHT11 sensor requires a single data pin.

2. We'll connect it to pin D0 (GPIO1) on the XIAO ESP32C6.

:::tip
For XIAO examples, only GPIO (Digital/Analog) and SPI protocol devices require manual pin configuration. For I2C and UART devices, the pin definitions are already pre-configured in XIAO's board package, so you can skip this step.
:::


## Gathering Technical Documentation


Having the technical documentation for your sensor is crucial. If you are using Seeed's products, you can find detailed documentation and resources for your sensor or actuator on **[Seeed Studio's official Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/)**. The wiki's resource section also contains datasheets for Grove products that you can provide to Cursor. For example, for the DHT11 sensor used in this project:

- [Grove DHT11 Wiki Page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/)

If you are using sensors from other manufacturers, please contact them directly to obtain the necessary technical documentation.


## Using Cursor's Chat to Generate Code

Now that we have all the necessary information, we can use Cursor's Chat to generate our Zigbee application code.

Here's where you'll need to create a prompt for Cursor's Chat.

### Sensor Project Template

If you, like me, choose to use a sensor as the device, you can refer to the following prompt.

```
Please refer to the code and then create an Arduino sensor project with ESP32-C6 using Zigbee protocol.

Project name: [project name]

Sensor details:
- Type: [sensor model]
- Connections: [pin connections]

Sensing specifications:
- Parameters to measure: [measurement values]
- Transmission frequency: [sending interval]

Reference materials:
- Documentation: [documentation links]

Generate a complete project in the Example directory. Name the main file [project name with spaces replaced by underscores].ino with comprehensive code comments.
```

Let's break down how to fill out the prompt template and provide an example using the DHT11 sensor:

1. **Project name**: Choose a descriptive name for your project
2. **Sensor details**:
   - Type: Specify the exact sensor model
   - Connections: List all pin connections between the sensor and XIAO ESP32C6
3. **Sensing specifications**: 
   - Parameters: List what you want to measure (temperature, humidity, etc.)
   - Transmission frequency: How often you want to send data (e.g., every 5 seconds)
4. **Reference materials**: Include links to datasheets or documentation

Here's a completed prompt for a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor project:

```
Please refer to the code and then create an Arduino sensor project with ESP32-C6 using Zigbee protocol.

Project name: Zigbee_DHT11_XIAO

Sensor details:
- Type: DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Connections: DHT11 data pin connected to D2 of XIAO ESP32C6

Sensing specifications:
- Parameters to measure: Temperature (¬∞C) and Relative Humidity (%)
- Transmission frequency: Every 1 hour

Reference materials:
- Documentation: 
  - DHT11 Sensor: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/
  - XIAO ESP32C6: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_pin_multiplexing_esp33c6/

Generate a complete project in the Example directory. Name the main file [project name with spaces replaced by underscores].ino with comprehensive code comments.
```

### Actuator Project Template

If you want to work with an actuator instead, you can use the following prompt template. Let's look at how to structure a prompt for an actuator project:


```
Please refer to the code and then create an Arduino actuator project with ESP32-C6 using Zigbee protocol.

Project name: [project name]

Actuator details:
- Type: [actuator model]
- Connections: [pin connections]

Control specifications:
- Default behavior: [startup state]

Reference materials:
- Documentation: [documentation links]

Generate a complete project in the Example directory. Name the main file [project name with spaces replaced by underscores].ino with comprehensive code comments.
```

:::tip
When building your first project with Cursor, it's recommended to start with simple, basic functionality rather than complex logic and requirements. This approach significantly reduces the likelihood of Cursor generating incorrect code. First, let Cursor create a working basic program that you can verify functions correctly. Once you have a solid foundation, you can gradually add more features and complexity to enhance your project. This iterative approach leads to more reliable and maintainable code.
:::


After preparing your prompt with all the specific details about your project, follow these steps:

1. Open Cursor's Chat panel (usually by clicking the chat icon in the sidebar).

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/6.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>


2. Locate the example code that most closely matches your project requirements. For our DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor project, we'll use the "Zigbee_Temp_Hum_Sensor_Sleepy" example.

3. Drag and drop the example code file(s) from the Zigbee examples directory into the Cursor Chat window. This helps Cursor understand the structure and requirements of Zigbee sensor implementations.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/7.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

4. Copy and paste our pre-written prompt into the chat input field and press Enter. Wait for Cursor to generate your project based on the prompt and example code.

<div class="table-center">
<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/9.mp4?autoplay=0" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</div>

5. Click the **Accept** button to save the generated code. This will create the project files in your workspace.


## Review the Generated Code

After Cursor generates the code, it's important to carefully review it before uploading to your device. Here are key aspects to check:

1. Pin Configuration

- Verify that all pin assignments match your physical connections
- Check that the pins specified are actually available on the XIAO ESP32C6
- Ensure no pin conflicts exist (e.g., same pin used for multiple purposes)
- Confirm the pins support the required functions (analog, digital, I2C, etc.)

2. Functionality Check

Compare the generated code against your requirements:
- Does it implement all the requested features?


For example, inside the programme it provided me, the pins are defined in terms of GPIO numbering, which may require reading the wiki and then checking that the XIAO's A/D numbering matches the correct GPIO numbering, which is more cumbersome. For this, we can ask Cursor to use the pins in the same way as A/D.

## Verify and Upload the Program

Now that Cursor has generated our Zigbee project code, we need to verify if it works correctly. The best way to do this is by using Arduino IDE, which provides excellent tools for compiling and uploading code to our XIAO ESP32C6 board. Let's switch to Arduino IDE and go through the verification process:

1. Open the main file in Arduino IDE.
2. Select **XIAO ESP32C6** board from the Boards menu.
3. Select the appropriate port.
4. Click **Verify** to compile the code.
5. If there are any errors, return to Cursor's Chat and ask for help fixing them.
6. Once the code compiles successfully, upload it to your XIAO ESP32C6.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/10.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If everything goes well, you should now have a Zigbee device that can be discovered by Home Assistant (provided you have a Zigbee gateway in your Home Assistant setup).

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/12.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Troubleshooting with Cursor

If you encounter issues with the generated code, you can ask Cursor for help:

1. Describe the specific error or issue you're facing
2. Include any error messages from the Arduino IDE
3. Ask Cursor to suggest fixes or improvements
4. Implement the suggested changes and test again

Cursor's AI is particularly good at debugging and can often identify issues that might be difficult to spot manually.

For example, if you're using Zigbee functionality for the first time or encounter a compilation error like 

```
#error Zigbee end device mode is not selected in Tools->Zigbee mode
```

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/15.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

due to oversight, you can always ask Cursor for guidance. Simply prompt: 

***I got a compilation error in Arduino IDE saying 'Compilation error: #error Zigbee end device mode is not selected in Tools->Zigbee mode'. What should I do?***

Cursor will likely suggest checking the Tools menu in Arduino IDE and selecting the appropriate Zigbee mode:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/16.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

You can ask Cursor about any errors you encounter, and it will help guide you through the resolution process. Some other common issues you might want to ask about include:

- Library installation problems
- Pin configuration errors
- Sensor connection issues
- Communication protocol setup
- Power management concerns

Just describe the issue clearly in your prompt, and Cursor will provide relevant suggestions and solutions.



## Enhancing Your Program with Cursor

After getting the basic Zigbee functionality working, you can use Cursor to add more features and improvements to your program. Let's look at an example of how to enhance the code by adding a serial port initialization check.

This is particularly useful during development and debugging, as it ensures you don't miss any serial output by waiting for the serial port to be ready before proceeding with the setup.

1. Open your project in Cursor and locate the `setup()` function in your code.

2. In the Chat panel, describe what you want to add. For example:
   "Add code to wait for serial port to be ready before proceeding with setup"

3. Cursor will suggest modifications like this:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/13.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Beyond these minor enhancements, we can maximize the value of Zigbee by implementing power-saving features on top of the basic functionality. One of Zigbee's key advantages is its low power consumption capabilities, which can be further optimized through proper implementation of sleep modes.

Here's how you could ask Cursor to add deep sleep functionality to your sensor project:

1. Open the Chat panel and request deep sleep implementation:

***Modify the programme so that the temperature and humidity values are reported once every three hours. Deep sleep the rest of the time to save power.***



2. Cursor will suggest code modifications that include:

- Updated the sleep duration
- Updated the sleep message for better feedback
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new reporting interval.
- Go back to deep sleep for 3 hours

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/cursor_zigbee_xiaoc6/14.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This power optimization is particularly valuable for battery-powered sensor nodes, potentially extending battery life from days to months or even years, depending on the reporting frequency and sensor type.

Cursor can help you implement all these features - just be specific in your requirements when asking for assistance.
