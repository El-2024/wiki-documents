# Linux Fundamentals

## **1. Introduction to Linux System**

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that has gained widespread adoption due to its reliability, flexibility, and performance. It’s widely used in servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems.

### Key Features of Linux:

- **Free and Open Source**: Linux’s source code is available for free, and users can modify it as per their requirements.
- **Multitasking**: Linux supports running multiple applications simultaneously.
- **Security**: It is known for its robust security features, such as file permissions, user management, and SELinux.
- **Portability**: Linux can run on a variety of hardware architectures.

## **2. Introduction to Linux File System**

Linux organizes its files and directories in a hierarchical structure. At the top of this structure is the root directory `/`, and from there, other directories branch out.

### Key Directories in the Linux File System:

- `/`: Root directory. It is the starting point of the Linux file system.
- `/home`: User home directories. Every user has a subdirectory here (e.g., `/home/user`).
- `/etc`: Configuration files for the system.
- `/bin`: Essential binary files and commands.
- `/var`: Variable data, such as logs and databases.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files.
- `/dev`: Device files that represent hardware components.

## **3. Using the Terminal and Command Line**

The terminal is a powerful tool for interacting with the Linux operating system. It allows users to issue commands to perform various tasks.

**Opening the Terminal:**

- Address of access：http://192.168.42.1/#/terminal（Default username and password：`recamera`）
- Log in remotely via the ssh [tool](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).
You can visit the reCamera remotely, by using the following command:
```
ssh recamera@recamera.local
```

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/ssh_connection.png" /></div>

Then hit ```Enter```, you should be able to now remotely control the reCamera.

### Basic Command Line Structure:

Commands in Linux follow a general structure:

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

For example, `ls -l /home/recamera` will list all files in the `/home/recamera` directory in long format.

## **4.User recamera && root**

The first time you use the recamera, you reset the default recamera password, which is also the password used to log in to the terminal.

:::note

When the password is entered in the terminal, the content will not be displayed. Press `Enter` to execute after the password is entered.

:::

The problem of insufficient permissions occurs in some special operations. To execute the command, you need to add sudo before executing the command. Or switch to the `root` user to execute all commands in the system.

The root user does not have a password set by default; use this command to set a password.

- `sudo passwd root`:Changing a user's password
- `su root`:Switch to the root user.

:::note

The root user can modify system-related files, which may lead to system failure. Please operate with caution.

## **5. Basic Linux Commands**

Here are some basic commands and their usage:

### File and Directory Management:

- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
- `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd [directory]`: Changes the current directory.
- `mkdir [directory]`: Creates a new directory.
- `rm [file]`: Removes a file.
- `rmdir [directory]`: Removes an empty directory.

### File Permissions and Ownership:

- `chmod [permissions] [file]`: Changes the permissions of a file.
- `chown [owner] [file]`: Changes the owner of a file.

### File Operations:

- `cp [source] [destination]`: Copies files or directories.
- `mv [source] [destination]`: Moves or renames files or directories.
- `cat [file]`: Displays the contents of a file.
- `nano [file]`: Opens a file in a text editor (Nano).

### System Information:

- `top`: Displays real-time system processes and resource usage.
<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/linux_fundamentals/image-2.png" /></div>
- `df`: Displays disk space usage.
<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/linux_fundamentals/image-3.png" /></div>
- `free`: Shows memory usage.
- `uname -r`: Displays the kernel version.

## 6.Transferring files

Linux offers several methods to transfer files between systems, whether it's over a local network or the internet. Below are the common tools and protocols used for file transfer in Linux.

### **Using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)**

SCP allows you to copy files securely between a local and a remote host or between two remote hosts.

#### Basic SCP Commands:

- Copy a file from local to remote:

  ```bash
  scp [file] username@remote_host:/path/to/destination
  ```

- Copy a file from remote to local:

  ```bash
  scp username@remote_host:/path/to/file /local/destination
  ```

- Copy a directory (use the `-r` flag for recursive copy):

  ```bash
  scp -r [directory] username@remote_host:/path/to/destination
  ```

#### Example:

To copy a file from your local machine to a remote server:

```bash
scp myfile.txt recamera@192.168.1.100:/home/recamera/
```

### **Using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)**

SFTP is another secure method of transferring files, and it operates over SSH. It allows you to interactively manage files on a remote server.

#### Basic SFTP Commands:

1. Start an SFTP session:

   ```bash
   sftp username@remote_host
   ```

2. Once connected, use the following commands:

   - `ls`: List files in the remote directory.
   - `cd [directory]`: Change remote directory.
   - `get [file]`: Download a file from the remote server to the local machine.
   - `put [file]`: Upload a file from the local machine to the remote server.
   - `exit`: Close the SFTP session.

#### Example:

To upload a file to a remote server:

```bash
sftp recamera@192.168.42.1
sftp> put myfile.txt /home/user/Documents/
```

## **7.Hardware Command**
