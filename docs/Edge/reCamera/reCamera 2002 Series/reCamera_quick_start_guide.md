## Step 1: Unboxing and Power On

Start by unpacking your reCamera. Inside the box, you should find:
- reCamera
- Type-C Cable
- Ethernet Cable

Make sure all parts are included.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/part_list.jpg" /></div>

Simply power on the device with the type-C cable provided. When you see the green light is on, that means the reCamera is ready to connnect to the world. 


**Light Indicators Status**:
- The green light in the middle means power-on.
- The flashing red light stands for the heartbeat of CPU.
- The blue light stands for the status of emmc. It flahses when reading or writing the emmc.


## Step 2: Network Connection

There are multiple methods to setup the network for reCamera, you can freely choose the one that suits for you. 

### Method 1: Wired Network Configuration via USB cable

If the USB cable is directly connected to your PC, you can then visit ```192.168.42.1``` to view the page for reCamera then choose the desire network. If you encounter any problems, you can view the network troubleshoot page. 

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Wi-Fi_list.png" /></div>

### Method 2: WIreless Network Configuration in AP mode

When power-on, reCamera will turn on the Access Point(AP) for you to change the network preference. Open your phone or laptop's Wi-Fi list, you should be able to see a Wi-Fi name called ```reCamera_******```. The naming system is "recamera_" + the last six digits of the mac address on this device. Default password is 
```12345678```.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/laptop_wifi_list.png" /></div>

Connect to this AP, and a website should automatically pop out for you. If not, you can always type **192.168.16.1** in your browser to visit the page. Then you can select which wifi you want the reCamera to connect to. If you have more than one reCamera, you can refer to the [Device Management](#jump1) to find out which one is which. 

### Method 3: Ethernet Port Network Configuration

If you would like use ethernet port, you can use the cable in the box to connect to your router. Note, this is not a POE (Power over Ethernet). You still need the type-c to power on the device. You can unscrew the back of the camera and connect through the port.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/ethernet_cable.png" /></div>

Once connected, you can find the IP of reCamera on your router backend, then visit the website and Node-red platform.

## SSH Remote Access

You can also visit the reCamera remotely, by using the following command:
```
ssh recamera@recamera.local
```

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/ssh_connection.png" /></div>

Default password is
```
recamera
```
Then hit ```Enter```, you should be able to now remotely control the reCamera.

### <span id="jump1"> Multi Devices Management </span>

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/mac_address_tag.png" /></div>

Or, once you connect the device to your laptop through USB or AP, you can view the mac address by using the following command
```
ifconfig wlan0
```

## Access reCamera Web Client

## Access pre-built Node-RED dashboard

We have integrated reCamera with the Node-red platform for you to develop and integrated more conveniently. With the network connected, you can visit the Node-red Dashboard by visiting the ```ip_address:1880``` in your browser. In here you can preview model, switch to other model, or even build out the application you need with all the handy nodes. Here is step by step instruction of how you can get the preview working.

## Multi Devices Management 

If you have more than one reCamera, you can distinguish them by the mac addrss on the back of the device.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/mac_address_tag.png" /></div>

Or, once you connect the device to your laptop through USB or AP, you can view the mac address by using the following command

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/last_six_digits.png" /></div>

## Camera Orientation
The default camera view orientation is like the image below where type-c is facing down. Please be awared that other orientation might effect the accuracy of model based on how you trained the detection model.
