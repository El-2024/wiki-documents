## Unboxing and Power On

Start by unpacking your reCamera. Inside the box, you should find:
- reCamera
- Type-C Cable
- Ethernet Cable

Make sure all parts are included.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/part_list.jpg" /></div>

Simply power on the device with the type-C cable provided. When you see the green light is on, that means the reCamera is ready to connect to the world. 


**Light Indicators Status**:

| LED(color) | Status | Statement |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| LED1 - Green | ON | Power On |
| LED2 - Red | Flashing | CPU Working(user define) |
| LED3 - Blue | Flashing | eMMC Reading/Writing |


## Network Connection

There are three methods to connect the reCamera to your network:

### Method 1: USB cable
**Wired Network Configuration via USB cable**

Connect the USB cable from reCamera to your PC, you can then visit ```192.168.42.1``` to view the loading page for reCamera.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/usbmode.png" /></div>

If you have reCamera with wireless function, we recommend to set up Wi-Fi connection. 

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Wi-Fi_list.png" /></div>

If you encounter any problems, please view the [network troubleshoot](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_network_connection/). 


### Method 2: Ethernet

**Ethernet Port Network Configuration**

If you would like use ethernet port, you can use the cable in the box to connect to your router. Note, this is not a POE (Power over Ethernet). You still need the type-c to power on the device. You can unscrew the back of the camera and connect through the port.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/IPmode.png" /></div>

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/ethernet_cable.png" /></div>

Once connected, you can find the IP of reCamera on your router backend, then visit the website and Node-RED platform.

### Method 3: AP mode

**Wireless Network Configuration in AP mode**

When power-on, reCamera will turn on the Access Point(AP) for you to change the network preference. Open your phone or laptop's Wi-Fi list, you should be able to see a Wi-Fi name called ```reCamera_******```. The naming system is "recamera_" + the last six digits of the mac address on this device. Default password is 
```12345678```.

<div align="center"><img width={300} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/laptop_wifi_list.png" /></div>

Connect to this AP, and a website should automatically pop out for you. If not, you can always type **192.168.16.1** in your browser to visit the page. Then you can select which wifi you want the reCamera to connect to. If you have more than one reCamera, you can refer to the [Device Management](#jump1) to find out which one is which. 


## Website Access
Once you have connected the reCamera to your network, you can visit the website by typing ```192.168.42.1``` in your browser. Please check your device OS version. The first batch of reCamera users received the OS with version 0.1.3. The second batch of users will be equipped with the system of version 0.1.5 or above. Please go to ```Sidebar -> System -> Software Update``` to check the software version, and apply and install the latest version of the OS. Update instruction please refer to [OTA upgrade guideline](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_getting_started/#ota-upgrade-from-013-to-latest-version).

```

### Function Statement:

**Counting Selection**: So far 4 kinds of object are support to be counted. There are Person, Cat, Dog, and Bottle. Multiple objects are supported by downloading model from sensecraft model zoo or uploading your customized model.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/dashboard1.png" /></div>

**Intersection over Union (IoU)**: IoU is a metric used to evaluate the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. It is calculated as the ratio of the intersection area of the two boxes to the union area of the two boxes. The value of IoU is typically in the range from 0 to 1. We standardized it to a scale of 0 - 100, an IoU value of 0 represents no overlap between the predicted box and the ground - truth box. A value of 100 indicates a perfect match, meaning the two boxes completely overlap.

**Confidence**: Confidence in the YOLO model represents the probability that a predicted bounding box contains an object and how accurate the prediction is. It is a value between 0 and 100.

**Step 6**. You can adjust the threshold of ```IoU``` and ```Confidence``` to get a more accurate result.

- IoU=0,Confidence=0:

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/dashboard2.png" /></div>

- IoU=25,Confidence=33:
