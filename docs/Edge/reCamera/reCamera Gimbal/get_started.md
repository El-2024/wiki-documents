# Getting Started with reCamera Gimbal

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/reCamera-Gimbal.png" /></div>

## Introduction

The reCamera gimbal 2002 series is the first open-source camera control system, composed of one tiny AI camera - reCamera 2002w 8GB/64GB, and one compatible 2-Axis gimbal basement with 2 brushless motors. It is powered by an RISC-V SoC, providing 1 TOPS AI performance with video encoding at 5MP @ 30 FPS. It offers a Lego-like self-assembly package and integrates the Sensecraft AI platform and Node-RED platform for smooth graphical programming and pipeline construction, enabling rapid self-training, model conversion, and deployment of AI models such as Yolo v5/v8/11.

:::note
The 12VDC power adapter is not included in the set. You need to select the appropriate power adapter from our bazaar selection screen or purchase one yourself.

### OTA OS upgrade
Please refer to the [OTA Upgrade Instruction](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_getting_started/#ota-upgrade-from-013-to-latest-version).

### Quick Start with Gimbal flow:

Visit this address to access Gimbal's preview screen: `ip_address/#/dashboard`

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_preview.png" /></div>

#### Parameters
**Yaw Abosilute Angle**(Left and right): The absolute angle of the yaw axis, which is the angle of rotation around the yaw axis. The range of this value is from 0 to 360 degrees for absolute position.

Example: parsing in `180` to the `Yaw Axis Absolute Position`, the motor will rotate to 180 degrees. 

**Pitch Abosilute Angle**(up and down): The absolute angle of the pitch axis, which is the angle of rotation around the pitch axis. The range of this value is from 0 to 180 degrees for absolute position.

Example: parsing in `5` to the `Pitch Axis Absolute Position`, the motor will rotate to 5 degrees.

**Motor Speed**: The speed of the motor. The range of this value is from 0 to 65535 dps/LSB.

Example: parsing in `100` to the `Pitch Axis Speed Setpoint`, means that the yaw axis speed will be set to `10000 dps/LSB`.

:::note
Please do not set the motor to extreme values such as 0, 180, or 360. Prolonged stay at these angles may cause damage to the motor.
:::

**Confidence**: Confidence in the YOLO model represents the probability that a predicted bounding box contains an object and how accurate the prediction is. It is a value between 0 and 100.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_confidence.png" /></div>


**Intersection over Union (IoU)**: IoU is a metric used to evaluate the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. It is calculated as the ratio of the intersection area of the two boxes to the union area of the two boxes. The value of IoU is typically in the range from 0 to 1. We standardized it to a scale of 0 - 100, an IoU value of 0 represents no overlap between the predicted box and the ground - truth box. A value of 100 indicates a perfect match, meaning the two boxes completely overlap.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_iou.png" /></div>

#### Manual Control

Yaw axis slider is used to control the left and right movement of the motor; Pitch axis slider is used to control the pitch motor moving up and down; The Speed axis slider is used to control the movement speed of the motor.

#### Node Modules

Gimbal adds four new modules over the default reCamera:

- CAN read : Send out all the input data from CANBus.
- CAN write: Write data frame to CANBus.
- CAN response：Read the response of the specified CAN request frame in CAN response node.
- Motor Config：Set the control command of the Gimbal motor.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_8.png" /></div>

You can copy and import the jsonflow below to test the preliminary control of the yaw-pitch motor.

The first input can control the motor to rotate to 90 degrees. The second input can increase the motor angle by 5 degrees. And the third input can control the motor operation speed.

```

#### Motor Config

In the Input Node, enter payload and below that, select the configuration you want to control the motor.

The input value of this module is digital, and the output is the CAN protocol control command frame of the motor.

The outlet CAN access `CAN write` or `CAN response` to execute control instructions.

More instructions on motor control can be found in this [document](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OSHW-reCamera-Series/blob/main/reCamera_Gimbal/MotorTools/CN/通讯协议/瓴控电机CAN协议说明 V2.36.pdf).

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_9.png" /></div>

#### CAN response

Click the plus icon to configure the CANBus interface as `can0` and `Baud rate` as 1000k bps.

The configuration of `CAN write` and `CAN read` is the same as that of this module.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_10.png" /></div>

<div align="center"><img width={300} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_11.png" /></div>

The communication mode of the CAN protocol is request-response, and the CAN response will return the reply frame of the command you sent. After the CAN response, access the debug module to view the content of the reply frame.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_12.png" /></div>
