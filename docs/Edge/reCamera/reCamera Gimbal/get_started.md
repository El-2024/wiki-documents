### Setup device and login

**Step1:** After assembling the Gimbal, connect the usb cable from reCamera Gimbal to your PC. Navigate to `192.168.42.1` on website and change the default password.  If you are using the WiFi AP setup mode, navigate instead to `192.168.16.1`

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_1.png" /></div>

:::note
Please remember your password, otherwise all logs will be erased to reset your device. If you forget the password, please [factory reset](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_getting_started/#factory-reset) your device.
:::

:::note
The default username and password are both `recamera`.  If you perform a factory reset or are using a new (unconfigured) device, these are the username and password to use.
:::

**Step2:** Here you'll be taken to the Gimbal Preview Dashboard. Before experiencing some motor movements with the controls on Dashboard, please go to `Network` to set up Wi-Fi.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/dashboard_network.png" /></div>

**Step3:** Connect to your Wi-Fi. After successfully connect to Wi-FI, click the `lock icon` to view the device IP address.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/view_wifi_IP.png" /></div>

**Step4:** Open a new browser tab and use this IP address to access the device.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_5.png" /></div>

**Step6:**  Connect the power to the base first, then remove the USB type C cable for best motor movements. 

:::note

It should be connected the power adapter with voltage 12V.

:::

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/switch_power.png" /></div>

**Step7:** Go back to your `ip address` browser to visit the dashboard, then hit `Calibrate button` on the right side to let your Gimbal calibrate itself. 

:::note

During calibration, avoid interfering with the device's operation as this could result in calibration failure. Calibration is performed automatically each time the gimbal is powered on.

:::

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/gimbal_calibrate.png" /></div>

### Calibration Behavior
The yaw axis has a movement range of 0‚Äì360¬∞, although the actual mechanical range is limited to approximately 345¬∞ due to structural constraints. However, the vision coverage remains 360¬∞. The pitch axis supports a movement range of 0‚Äì180¬∞.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/movement_range.png" /></div>

Upon powering on, the gimbal will begin its automatic calibration sequence:

- **Yaw Axis**: The gimbal will first rotate clockwise toward its mechanical limit (positioned above the power cable), then rotate counterclockwise to the opposite limit. After reaching both ends, it will return to the center position.

- **Pitch Axis**: The gimbal will tilt upward to the 0¬∞ position, then downward to reach the 180¬∞ limit, and finally return to the center.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/calibrate.gif" /></div>

This sequence completes the gimbal's self-calibration process.

You can also calibrate by enter this command in the terminal
```bash
gimbal cali
```

### Troubleshooting Calibration Issues

If the gimbal does not perform the calibration sequence correctly, there may be several potential causes:

- **Verify the Mechanical Limitations**: Manually check the gimbal to ensure that the movement range is not obstructed or limited incorrectly.

- **Check Resistance From 3D Printed Parts**: Feel for any resistance when the motor moves. If the resistance is excessive, you may need to adjust the motor's PID settings to increase motor force. You can view [how to adjust PID here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recamera_pid_adjustment). Alternatively, reduce friction by sanding any parts or slightly loosening screws to improve movement.

## Basic Web Access

Web urls:

- **Preview Page**: `ip_address/#/dashboard`

- **Home Page**: `ip_address/#/init`
- **Workspace**: `ip_address/#/workspace`
- **Network Configuration**: `ip_address/#/network`
- **Security**: `ip_address/#/security`
- **Terminal**: `ip_address/#/terminal`
- **System**: `ip_address/#/system`
- **Power**: `ip_address/#/power`
- **Original Node-RED**: `ip_address:1880`

### Quick Start with Gimbal Dashboard:
#### Motors control
After setup and calibration are complete, you can control the gimbal using the available options in the dashboard. Visit `ip_address/#/dashboard` or `ip_address` to access Gimbal's preview dashboard made with Node-RED nodes: 

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_preview.png" /></div>

- **Joystick**: Controls the direction of the camera's view. For example, dragging the joystick to the right causes the image to move right accordingly.
- **Sliders**: 
  - Yaw and Pitch Sliders: Move the gimbal to a specified absolute angle.

    Yaw range: 0‚Äì360¬∞

    Pitch range: 0‚Äì180¬∞

:::note
Due to structural constraints, the yaw range is limited to 0‚Äì345¬∞ and the pitch range is limited to 0‚Äì180¬∞. Any values entered outside of these ranges will be adjusted to the closest boundary. For example, if you input 360¬∞ for yaw, the system will automatically execute the movement as 345¬∞.
:::

  - Speed Slider: Adjusts the speed of both motors simultaneously.

    Speed range: 0‚Äì720¬∞/s (degrees per second)
- **Auto-Tracking**: Select a target object from the dropdown menu (e.g., person, car, cat, dog, bottle), then click `Start Tracking` to initiate automatic object tracking. Click `Stop Tracking` to end tracking.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_tarck.png" /></div>

- **Sleep Button**: Moves the gimbal to an absolute position of (Yaw: 180¬∞, Pitch: 180¬∞).

:::note

The Sleep button does not activate a low-power sleep mode. It simply repositions the camera to face downward.

:::

- **Standby Button**: Moves the gimbal to an absolute position of (Yaw: 180¬∞, Pitch: 90¬∞).
- **Calibrate Button**: Initiates the gimbal calibration process.
- **Emergency Stop Button**:Immediately disables both motors during movement.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This will not interrupt the calibration process.

#### AI Model Parameters
**Confidence**: Confidence in the YOLO model represents the probability that a predicted bounding box contains an object and how accurate the prediction is. It is a value between 0 and 100.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/Gimbal_confidence.png" /></div>


**Intersection over Union (IoU)**: IoU is a metric used to evaluate the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. It is calculated as the ratio of the intersection area of the two boxes to the union area of the two boxes. The value of IoU is typically in the range from 0 to 1. We standardized it to a scale of 0 - 100, an IoU value of 0 represents no overlap between the predicted box and the ground - truth box. A value of 100 indicates a perfect match, meaning the two boxes completely overlap.

### Quick start with Gimbal Dashboard Flow:

If you would like to know how the dashboard is made with Node-RED nodes, click the bottom right corner or visit `ip_address/#/workspace` to access Gimbal's Node-RED workspace

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/dashboard_to_workspace.png" /></div>

Then you will see the default gimbal dashboard flow, you can double click in each node to view the detail of the node. The dashboard flow will look like this:

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/Gimbal/workspace_flow.png" /></div>

**Model Settings**: 
  - Slider nodes allow you to adjust the IoU (Intersection over Union) and confidence threshold for the YOLO AI model.

**Dashboard UI Display**:
  - The UI template node displays text showing the current model settings.
  - It also renders the base64 image from the camera, including detection boxes for objects identified by YOLO.

**Auto Tracking with Target**:

  - Function nodes retrieve information about the target object (e.g., width, height, coordinates) and process this data using a tracking algorithm.

  - The algorithm function node calculates the offset of the target box center relative to the vision center and sends this offset to the set motor angle node to move the gimbal to the desired position.

**Manual Motor Control**:

  - Use slider nodes to manually set motor angles, moving the gimbal by a specific degree.

  - Alternatively, the joystick UI node allows manual control by adjusting the gimbal's position in small increments (offset-by-offset).

**Shortcut Buttons**:

  - Button UI nodes send specific positions to the set motor angle node, triggering behaviors like Sleep or Standby.

  - These buttons can also trigger exec nodes running bash scripts such as `gimbal cali` for calibration or `gimbal stop 1; gimbal stop 2` for an emergency stop.

**Basic Web Iframe Subflow**:

  - An iframe subflow displays basic web pages like network settings, system info, and device information.

  - Note that these may consume CPU resources as it renders the page with multiple nodes. It can be deleted if not needed.
