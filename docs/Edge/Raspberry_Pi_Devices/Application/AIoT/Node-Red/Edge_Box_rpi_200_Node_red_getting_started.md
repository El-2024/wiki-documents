## Introduction

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a versatile programming tool designed to connect hardware devices, APIs, and online services seamlessly. Its browser-based flow editor simplifies the process of wiring together different components using a variety of nodes from the palette. With a lightweight runtime built on Node.js, it efficiently utilizes the Raspberry Pi and other low-cost hardware, making it perfect for edge network applications.

## Getting Start

Before you start this project, you may need to prepare your hardware and software in advance as described here.

          </a></div></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>

### Software Preparation

Edge Box-200 comes to your hand pre installed raspberry pi OS. If you are booting this device first time please read our [Getting Started](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Edge_Box_introduction/) Wiki

## Install Node Red on Edge box 

- **Step 01**: SSH to Edgebox 
Please open PowerShell if you using windows or open Terminal APP if you are using  program and then type ssh `{USERNAME}@{EDGEBOX_IP_ADDRESS}`. As example 

```sh
ssh pi@192.168.43.100
```
Then please enter the password for the `{USER}` of the Operating System you have setup on your Edge Box.

- **Step 02**: Install Node-RED

The Node-RED team has prepared us with a All-IN-ONE script, which you could just enter the following command into the EdgeBox native Terminal APP (via VNC viewer) or in the SSH Shell from the step above.

```sh
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
```
At the end of the installation, there will be a couple of questions asked by the prompt, and you need to answer them.

- **Step 03**: Setup Node-Red
After the installation with the All-IN-ONE script is complete, you can use follow commands accordingly:

Use `node-red-start`                   to start Node-RED<br />
Use `node-red-stop`                    to stop Node-RED <br />
Use `node-red-start`                   to start Node-RED again <br />
Use `node-red-log`                     to view the recent log output <br />
Use `sudo systemctl enable nodered.service `to autostart Node-RED at every boot <br />
Use `sudo systemctl disable nodered.service `to disable autostart on boot <br />

- **Step 04**: Access Node-RED editor

Now please open your favorite Web Browser and enter the url described as below:

* Option 1: Use http://127.0.0.1:1880, if the web browser is running locally on your Edgebox via VNC.

* Option 2: Use http://{EdgeBox_IP_ADDRESS}:1880, if the web browser is running remotely on a host computer, please replace the {EdgeBox_IP_ADDRESS} with the ip address of EdgeBox.

## Getting familiar with Node-RED

Now you should see the similar result as the image below:

### Node-RED editor Overview

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Edge_Box/nodered/node-editor.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

* **Node Panel**: The area where users can browse and select nodes from a palette to add to their flows.
* **Flow Editor**: The workspace where users visually connect nodes together to create their flows.
* **Config Panel**: The section where users can configure the properties and settings of selected nodes.
* **Settings Button**: Allows users to access and adjust various settings and preferences for the Node-RED editor.
* **Deploy Button**: Enables users to deploy their flows to the Node-RED runtime, making them active and operational.

### Install Nodes 

There are a couple of options: one is using command lines, and the next one is using the Node-RED editor. Here, I will explain the simplest method, which is using the Node-RED editor.

- **Step 1**: Click the Settings button with **three dash** icon located at the right corner and then select the Manage palette

- **Step 2**: At the palette tab click Install tab

- **Step 3**: Search for the node in the node search bar and Click install button to install

- **Step 4**: click on **Install** button from the dropdown warning window to confirm install

- **Step 5**: Wait for the installation to complete and you should see the install button changed to installed.

- **Step 6**: you should see the installed nodes in the side bar.
