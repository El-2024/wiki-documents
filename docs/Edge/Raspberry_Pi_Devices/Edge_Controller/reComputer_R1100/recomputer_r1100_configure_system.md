## Query GPIO Mappings and Offsets

To check GPIO mappings and offsets, follow these steps:
- **Run the following command in the terminal**

```bash
cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
```

**This command will display GPIO mappings and offsets**, providing essential information for debugging or configuring GPIO pins.

## Control LED Indicators 

 
The reComputer R1100 provides three **LED indicators** in **red, blue, and green**. You can control them using the following commands:  

**1. Navigate to the LED directory**  
```bash
cd /sys/class/leds/
ls
```
This will list the available LEDs.

**2. Enable LEDs by writing to the brightness file**  
Switch to **superuser mode** first:  
```bash
sudo su
```
Then, turn on the LEDs:  
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led-red/brightness
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led-blue/brightness
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led-green/brightness
```
This will **light up** the corresponding LED.

**3. Turn off LEDs (optional)**  
To **turn off** a specific LED, use:
```bash
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led-red/brightness
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led-blue/brightness
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led-green/brightness
```

## Testing SPI Communication 

To verify **SPI communication**, you can perform a loopback test by **shorting the TPM module's MISO and MOSI pins**. This method ensures that data sent on MOSI (Master Out, Slave In) is received on MISO (Master In, Slave Out).  


**Step-by-Step Guide**  

**1. Connect to the Internet**  
Make sure your device is connected to a network before proceeding.

**2. Clone the `spidev-test` repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rm-hull/spidev-test.git
```

**3. Navigate into the directory**  

```bash
cd spidev-test
```

**4. Compile the `spidev_test.c` program**  
```bash
gcc spidev_test.c -o spidev_test
```

**5. Run the SPI test**

```bash
./spidev_test -D /dev/spidev0.1 -v -p "hello"
```
- `-D /dev/spidev0.1` ‚Üí Specifies the SPI device  
- `-v` ‚Üí Enables verbose output  
- `-p "hello"` ‚Üí Sends the string `"hello"`  

**6. Loopback Test (Optional)**  
- **Short the TPM module's MISO and MOSI pins** before running the test.
- If the SPI bus is functioning correctly, the output should show the transmitted data being **received correctly**.



## Wi-Fi Scanning 
To list available Wi-Fi networks and their details, run:  
```bash
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
```
- This command scans for all nearby Wi-Fi networks and displays their SSIDs, signal strength, and encryption type.  



## Bluetooth Scanning  
To scan for Bluetooth devices, follow these steps:  

**Open the Bluetooth control interface:**  
```bash
sudo bluetoothctl
```

**Enable scanning:**  
```bash
scan on
```
- This starts scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices.  

## LoRa¬Æ over Mini-PCIe 



### LoRa¬Æ SPI Configuration  

**Clone the SX1302_HAL repository:**  

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Lora-net/sx1302_hal
```

**Navigate to the cloned directory:** 

```bash
cd sx1302_hal
```

**Modify the configuration file:**  

Open the I2C device configuration file:  

```bash
sudo vim ./libloragw/inc/loragw_i2c.h
```
Change this line:  
```c
#define I2C_DEVICE "/dev/i2c-1"
```
To:  
```c
#define I2C_DEVICE "/dev/i2c-3"
```

**Compile the code:** 

```bash
sudo make
```

**Modify the reset script:**

Open the `reset_lgw.sh` script:  

```bash
sudo vim ./tools/reset_lgw.sh
```
Update the pin configurations: 

```bash
SX1302_RESET_PIN=580    # SX1302 reset  
SX1302_POWER_EN_PIN=578 # SX1302 power enable  
SX1261_RESET_PIN=579    # SX1261 reset (LBT/Spectral Scan)  
```

**Copy the reset script to the packet forwarder directory:**  

```bash
cp ~/sx1302_hal/tools/reset_lgw.sh ~/sx1302_hal/packet_forwarder/
```

**Update the default SPI port in the LoRaWAN¬Æ configuration file:**  

Modify the `global_conf.json.sx1250.US915` file:  
```bash
sed -i 's/spidev0.0/spidev0.1/g' global_conf.json.sx1250.US915
```

**Start the LoRaWAN¬Æ module:**  

```bash
cd ~/sx1302_hal/packet_forwarder
sudo ./lora_pkt_fwd -c global_conf.json.sx1250.US915
```

### LoRa¬Æ USB Configuration
If you are using a LoRa¬Æ USB module instead of LoRa¬Æ SPI, follow these steps. Most commands remain the same as for LoRa¬Æ SPI, except for the final step.

**Pull up the SX1302 Reset Pin**

```bash
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio580/value
```
**Start the LoRaWAN¬Æ USB module**

```bash
cd ~/sx1302_hal/packet_forwarder
sudo ./lora_pkt_fwd -c global_conf.json.sx1250.EU868.USB
```
 LoRa¬Æ USB is now configured and running on reComputer R1100



## 4G Cellular over Mini-PCIe

To interact with a 4G module using AT commands via `minicom`, follow these steps:  

**Open Minicom with the appropriate serial port and baud rate:**  

```bash
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2 -b 115200
```
This command opens Minicom with the specified serial port (`/dev/ttyUSB2`) at a baud rate of **115200**.  

**Send AT commands to the 4G module:**  

Once Minicom is open, you can start sending **AT commands** to the 4G module. For example:  

```bash
AT
```
This command checks if the module is responsive. If the module is working properly, you should receive an **"OK"** response.  

**Dial a phone number using the 4G module:**  

To dial a phone number, use the `ATD` command followed by the phone number:  

```bash
ATD<phone_number>;
```
- Replace `<phone_number>` with the desired phone number you want to dial.  
- Make sure to include a **semicolon (;)** at the end of the command to indicate the end of the phone number.

```  
**Both modules must be in transparent mode for direct communication.**  
To **exit transparent mode**, send:  
```  
+++  
```

**Additional Notes**  
- If **router configuration fails**, the device may already be a **coordinator**. To leave the network, send:  
  ```  
  55 07 00 04 02 XXXX XX  
  ```  
- To **test transmission power**, use:  
  - **Query power:**  
    ```  
    55 04 0D 00 00 0D  
    ```  
  - **Set power:**  
    ```  
    55 04 0D 01 XXXX  
    ```  

Ensure you replace `/dev/ttyUSB*` with the **correct serial port** for each Zigbee module.  
Follow these steps carefully to establish **successful Zigbee communication** between the two modules.

## RS485 Testing 

The reComputer R1100 includes **two RS485 ports**. Below are their corresponding **COM ports** and **device files**:  

| **RS485 Port** | **COM Port** | **Silkscreen Label** | **Device File** |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **RS485_1**  | COM1        | A1 / B1 / GND       | `/dev/ttyACM0` |
| **RS485_2**  | COM2        | A2 / B2 / GND       | `/dev/ttyACM1` |

**Steps to Test RS485 Functionality**  

**Connect the RS485 Ports**  

Physically connect **RS485_1 (A & B)** to **RS485_2 (A & B)**.  

**Run the RS485 Test Program**  

We provide a test program to **verify data transmission** and measure the speed between the two RS485 ports.  

Run the following commands to download and execute the test program:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ackPeng/R1100_TEST.git
cd R1100_TEST
gcc -o serial_test serial_test.c
./serial_test /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyACM1 115200
```

**Test Description**  
- This program **sends 1MB of data** from **RS485_1** to **RS485_2**.  
- It **records the completion time** and calculates the actual baud rate.  
- **Note:** The actual baud rate may be slightly lower than the theoretical baud rate, which is expected.  

**Follow these steps carefully to verify RS485 communication on reComputer R1100.** 

## RS232 Testing 

The reComputer R1100 features **two RS232 ports**. Below are the corresponding COM ports and device files:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd  
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd  
```

**Manually Set the RTC Time**

Set the RTC to a specific date and time (e.g., November 12, 2024, at 12:00 PM):  
```bash
sudo hwclock --set --date "2024-11-12 12:00:00"
```

**Sync RTC Time to the System**

Update the system time to match the RTC time:  
```bash
sudo hwclock --hctosys
```

**Verify the RTC Time**  
Check the current time stored in the RTC:  
```bash
sudo hwclock -r
```
This command will display the RTC time.

**Test RTC Retention**  
- **Disconnect the power source** from the RTC.  
- **Wait a few minutes**.  
- **Reconnect the power** and check the RTC time again using:  
  ```bash
  sudo hwclock -r
  ```
- If the time remains correct, the RTC is functioning properly.  

## Watchdog Timer Testing 

To test the **watchdog timer** on **reComputer R1100**, follow these steps:  

**Install Watchdog Software**  

Ensure the watchdog package is installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install vim  # Install Vim if not already installed  
sudo vim /etc/watchdog.conf
```
Modify the configuration as follows:  
```ini
watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog  

# Set the hardware timeout (default is 1 minute)
watchdog-timeout = 120  

# Set the interval between tests (should be shorter than watchdog-timeout)
interval = 15  

# Set system load limits  
max-load-1 = 24  
# max-load-5 = 18  
# max-load-15 = 12  

# Enable real-time priority  
realtime = yes  
priority = 1  
```

**Start the Watchdog Service**  
Enable and start the watchdog service:  
```bash
sudo systemctl start watchdog
```



**Test the Watchdog by Simulating a System Hang** 

Trigger a **kernel crash** to see if the watchdog **automatically reboots** the system:  
```bash
sudo su
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
echo "c" > /proc/sysrq-trigger
```

**Monitor the System**  
Check if the system **automatically reboots** after the specified **timeout period**.  

**If the reboot occurs as expected, the watchdog is functioning properly.**

```
**If the camera preview starts successfully, the setup is complete!**  


## TPM 2.0 Connection Check 

If you have connected a **TPM 2.0 module** to your device, you can verify its detection using the following command:  

```bash
ls /dev | grep tpm
```  

**Interpreting the Output:**  

- If you see **`tpm0`** and **`tpmrm0`** in the output, it confirms that the **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** is successfully detected and available.  
- This indicates that the TPM hardware is recognized and accessible, allowing you to proceed with TPM-related functionalities or applications.  

**If the devices are listed, your TPM module is properly connected and ready for use.**  


## Interacting with ATECC608A and Generating a Random Serial Number 

To communicate with the **ATECC608A** device and generate a random serial number, follow these steps:  

**Clone the `atecc-util` Repository:**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wirenboard/atecc-util.git

```bash
cd atecc-util
```  

**Clone the `cryptoauthlib` Repository:**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wirenboard/cryptoauthlib.git
```  

**Compile the ATECC Utility:** 

```bash
make
```  

**Generate a Random Serial Number:**  

```bash
./atecc -b 1 -s 192 -c 'serial'
```  
- **`-b 1`** ‚Üí Uses slot 1.  
- **`-s 192`** ‚Üí Sets the serial number size to **192 bits**.  
- **`-c 'serial'`** ‚Üí Generates a random serial number.  

**Expected Output:**  

The generated serial number will be displayed, for example:  
```bash
01235595d3d621f0ee
```  

This method enables interaction with the **ATECC608A** device, allowing you to perform operations like generating random serial numbers efficiently.  

## Interacting with EEPROM 

To read and write data to an **EEPROM** (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), follow these steps:  

**Grant Full Permissions to the EEPROM Device File:**  
```bash
sudo chmod 777 /sys/bus/i2c/devices/6-0050/eeprom
```  

**Write Data to the EEPROM:**  
```bash
echo "This is a test string" > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/6-0050/eeprom
```  

**Read the EEPROM Contents in Hexadecimal Format:**  

```bash
cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/6-0050/eeprom | hexdump -C
```  
## Checking SSD Detection

To list all connected disks, including the SSD, use the following command:  
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```  

This command will display a list of all detected storage devices. Look for entries that represent your SSD, typically labeled as:  
- `/dev/sda`  
- `/dev/sdb`  
- `/dev/sdc`, etc.  

Once you identify the correct SSD entry, you can proceed with **partitioning, formatting, or other disk management tasks** as needed. 



## UPS for Safe Shutdown 

A **GPIO6** connection between the **CPU and DC power-in** is used to notify the CPU when the power supply is down. The CPU must execute **urgent tasks via a script** before the supercapacitor‚Äôs energy is depleted and then initiate a **safe shutdown (`$shutdown`)**.  

**Alternative Shutdown Method**  
Another way to use this function is to **trigger a shutdown when the GPIO pin changes state**. The specified GPIO pin is configured as an **input key**, generating **KEY_POWER events**. These events are handled by **systemd-logind**, which automatically initiates a system shutdown.  

To enable this function, refer to `/boot/overlays/README`, then modify `/boot/firmware/config.txt` by adding:  
```ini
dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=6,active_low=1
```

#### Python Code for Safe Shutdown  
The following Python script demonstrates **how to detect the working mode** of the **supercapacitor UPS via GPIO6**. When the system detects a power-off event, it **automatically saves data and shuts down safely**.  

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
import os

num = 0

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  # Set GPIO numbering mode
GPIO.setup(6, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)  # Set GPIO6 as input with pull-up resistor
GPIO.add_event_detect(6, GPIO.FALLING, bouncetime=500)  # Add debounce time for stabilization

while True:
    if GPIO.event_detected(6):
        print("...External power off detected...")
        os.system("sync")  # Ensure data is written to disk
        print("...Saving data...")
        time.sleep(3)
        os.system("sync")  # Save data again
        
        while num < 5:
            print(f"--- {5 - num} seconds remaining ---")
            num += 1
            time.sleep(1)

        os.system("sudo shutdown -h now")  # Execute system shutdown
```
