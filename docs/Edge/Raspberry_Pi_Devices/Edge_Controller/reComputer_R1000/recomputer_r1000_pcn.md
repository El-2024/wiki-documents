## Introduction
We found that some users have trouble with DE pin control when using the modbus function of reComputer R1000 V1.0. For better user experience, we modified the pin assignment to make RS485 more usable.And made some adjustments to the overall product.



## Change Description
1 Add a new antenna hole. As shown in the following figure. Now there are 3 antenna holes.  The interface screen printing has been adjusted accordingly.
