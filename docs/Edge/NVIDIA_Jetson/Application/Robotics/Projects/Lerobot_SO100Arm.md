The 3D printed parts and table clamps are not included in the product. However, the SO-100ARM provides detailed [3D printing STL files](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main/stl_files_for_3dprinting) and printing parameters. Besides, we also offer the [3D printed parts of the Table Clamp](https://makerworld.com/zh/models/908660).
:::

### 3D Printing Guide
A variety of 3D printers are acceptable to print the parts necessary of the follower and leader arm. Follow the steps below to ensure a good print. 
1. Choose a printer: The STL files provided ready to print on many FDM printers. Below are the tested and suggested settings though others may work.
    - Material: PLA
    - Nozzle Diameter and Precision: 0.4mm nozzle diameter at 0.2mm layer height or 0.6mm nozzle at 0.4mm layer height.
    - Infill Density: 13%

2. Acquisition of 3D printing files: All the parts for the leader or follower are contained in a single file, correctly orientated for z upwards to minimize supports.

    For printer bed sizes of 220mmx220mm (such as the Ender), print:
    - [Print_Follower_SO_ARM100_08_Ender.STL](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/stl_files_for_3dprinting/Follower/Print_Follower_SO_ARM100_08k_Ender.STL)
    - [Print_Leader_SO_ARM100_08_Ender.STL](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/stl_files_for_3dprinting/Leader/Print_Leader_SO_ARM100_08k_Ender.STL)

    For printer bed sizes of 205mm x 250mm (such as the Prusa/Up), print:
    - [Print_Follower_SO_ARM100_08_UP_Prusa.STL](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/stl_files_for_3dprinting/Follower/Print_Follower_SO_ARM100_08k_UP_Prusa.STL)
    - [Print_Leader_SO_ARM100_08_UP_Prusa.STL](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/stl_files_for_3dprinting/Leader/Print_Leader_SO_ARM100_08k_UP_Prusa.STL)

For the convenience of downloading, we have already packaged all the files on the [Makerworld platform](https://makerworld.com/zh/models/908660), including the Table Clamps.


### Install LeRobot

On your reComputer Nvidia Jetson:
1. Install Miniconda:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
cd ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
```
2. Restart shell or `source ~/.bashrc`

3. Create and activate a fresh conda environment for lerobot
```bash 
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.10 && conda activate lerobot
```

4. Clone Lerobot:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git ~/lerobot
```

5. Install LeRobot with dependencies for the feetech motors:

```bash
cd ~/lerobot && pip install -e ".[feetech]"
```
For Linux only (not Mac), install extra dependencies for recording datasets:
```bash
conda install -y -c conda-forge ffmpeg
pip uninstall -y opencv-python
conda install -y -c conda-forge "opencv>=4.10.0"
```

### Configure the motors

Follow steps 1 of the [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FioA2oeFZ5I) which illustrates the use of our scripts below.

<iframe width="960" height="640" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FioA2oeFZ5I?si=GjudmAovwF_X5m2f" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


**Find USB ports associated to your arms**
To find the correct ports for each arm, run the utility script twice:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/find_motors_bus_port.py
```

Example output when identifying the leader arm's port (e.g., `/dev/tty.usbmodem575E0031751` on Mac, or possibly `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux):

Example output when identifying the follower arm's port (e.g., `/dev/tty.usbmodem575E0032081`, or possibly `/dev/ttyACM1` on Linux):

Troubleshooting: On Linux, you might need to give access to the USB ports by running:
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1
```

**Configure your motors**
Plug your first motor and run this script to set its ID to 1. It will also set its present position to 2048, so expect your motor to rotate:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/configure_motor.py \
  --port /dev/ttyACM0 \
  --brand feetech \
  --model sts3215 \
  --baudrate 1000000 \
  --ID 1
```

Note: These motors are currently limitated. They can take values between 0 and 4096 only, which corresponds to a full turn. They can't turn more than that. 2048 is at the middle of this range, so we can take -2048 steps (180 degrees anticlockwise) and reach the maximum range, or take +2048 steps (180 degrees clockwise) and reach the maximum range. The configuration step also sets the homing offset to 0, so that if you misassembled the arm, you can always update the homing offset to account for a shift up to ¬± 2048 steps (¬± 180 degrees).

Then unplug your motor and plug the second motor and set its ID to 2.

```bash
python lerobot/scripts/configure_motor.py \
  --port /dev/ttyACM0 \
  --brand feetech \
  --model sts3215 \
  --baudrate 1000000 \
  --ID 2
```

Redo the process for all your motors until ID 6. Do the same for the 6 motors of the leader arm.

### Assembly
Detailed video instructions are on the [HuggingFace Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FioA2oeFZ5I)

### Calibrate

Next, you'll need to calibrate your SO-100 robot to ensure that the leader and follower arms have the same position values when they are in the same physical position. This calibration is essential because it allows a neural network trained on one SO-100 robot to work on another.

:::info
The calibration of the robotic arm should be carried out strictly in accordance with the ["Calibrate"](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/10_use_so100.md#calibrate) steps in the official tutorial of Lerobot.
:::


**Manual calibration of follower arm**

Firstly, you need to ensure that the serial port numbers of the robotic arm in the `\lerobot\lerobot\configs\robot\so100.yaml` file are consistent with yours, as shown in the following figure. You can view all serial port names according to `ls /dev/ttyACM*`.

<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
    src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/projects/lerobot/so100yaml.png" />
</div>


You will need to move the follower arm to these positions sequentially:

<iframe width="960" height="640" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1z9Dlk1gW8?si=Ln2PFmPnap2AeDZc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Make sure both arms are connected and run this script to launch manual calibration:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py calibrate \
    --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml \
    --robot-overrides '~cameras' --arms main_follower
```

**Manual calibration of leader arm**
Follow step 6 of the [assembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FioA2oeFZ5I) which illustrates the manual calibration. You will need to move the leader arm to these positions sequentially:

Run this script to launch manual calibration:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py calibrate \
    --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml \
    --robot-overrides '~cameras' --arms main_leader
```


### Teleoperate

**Simple teleop**
Then you are ready to teleoperate your robot! Run this simple script (it won't connect and display the cameras):
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py teleoperate \
    --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml \
    --robot-overrides '~cameras' \
    --display-cameras 0
```

<iframe width="960" height="640" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnRwfcyX1ZI?si=RuzYjP_FUTK16lfs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Teleop with displaying cameras### 
After inserting your two USB cameras, run the following script to check the port numbers of the cameras.
```bash
python lerobot/common/robot_devices/cameras/opencv.py \
    --images-dir outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras
```

The terminal will print out the following information.
```markdown
Mac or Windows detected. Finding available camera indices through scanning all indices from 0 to 60
[...]
Camera found at index 2
Camera found at index 4
[...]
Connecting cameras
OpenCVCamera(2, fps=30.0, width=640, height=480, color_mode=rgb)
OpenCVCamera(4, fps=30.0, width=640, height=480, color_mode=rgb)
Saving images to outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras
Frame: 0000	Latency (ms): 39.52
[...]
Frame: 0046	Latency (ms): 40.07
Images have been saved to outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras
```

You can find the pictures taken by each camera in the `outputs/images_from_opencv_cameras` directory, and confirm the port index information corresponding to the cameras at different positions. Then complete the alignment of the camera parameters in the `\lerobot\lerobot\configs\robot\so100.yaml` file.


<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
    src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/projects/lerobot/so100camerayaml.png" />
</div>

Then you will be able to display the cameras on your computer while you are teleoperating by running the following code. This is useful to prepare your setup before recording your first dataset.
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py teleoperate \
    --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml
```

<iframe width="960" height="640" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUcXlLlOjGE?si=6ncQ7o5ZFLR4PGTU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Record the dataset

Once you're familiar with teleoperation, you can record your first dataset with SO-100.

If you want to use the Hugging Face hub features for uploading your dataset and you haven't previously done it, make sure you've logged in using a write-access token, which can be generated from the [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens):
```bash
huggingface-cli login --token ${HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN} --add-to-git-credential
```

Store your Hugging Face repository name in a variable to run these commands:
```bash
HF_USER=$(huggingface-cli whoami | head -n 1)
echo $HF_USER
```

Record 2 episodes and upload your dataset to the hub:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py record \
    --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml \
    --fps 30 \
    --repo-id ${HF_USER}/so100_test \
    --tags so100 tutorial \
    --warmup-time-s 5 \
    --episode-time-s 40 \
    --reset-time-s 10 \
    --num-episodes 2 \
    --push-to-hub 1
    --single-task seeedstudio
```

```markdown
Parameter Explanations
- wormup-time-s: It refers to the initialization time.
- episode-time-s: It represents the time for collecting data each time.
- reset-time-s: It is the preparation time between each data collection.
- num-episodes: It indicates how many groups of data are expected to be collected.
- push-to-hub: It determines whether to upload the data to the HuggingFace Hub. 
```

<iframe width="960" height="640" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wc-qh7UFkuQ?si=-eDB73KgUksyJXa-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Visualize the dataset

If you uploaded your dataset to the hub with `--push-to-hub 1`, you can [visualize your dataset online](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lerobot/visualize_dataset) by copy pasting your repo id given by:
```bash
echo ${HF_USER}/so100_test
```

If you didn't upload with `--push-to-hub 0`, you can also visualize it locally with:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/visualize_dataset_html.py \
  --repo-id ${HF_USER}/so100_test
```

  <div align="center">
      <img width={800} 
      src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/robotics/projects/lerobot/visualize_datasets.png" />
  </div>

### Replay an episode

Now try to replay the first episode on your robot:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py replay \
    --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml \
    --fps 30 \
    --repo-id ${HF_USER}/so100_test \
    --episode 0
```

### Train a policy

To train a policy to control your robot, use the `python lerobot/scripts/train.py` script. A few arguments are required. Here is an example command:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
  dataset_repo_id=${HF_USER}/so100_test \
  policy=act_so100_real \
  env=so100_real \
  hydra.run.dir=outputs/train/act_so100_test \
  hydra.job.name=act_so100_test \
  device=cuda \
  wandb.enable=false
```

Let's explain it:
1. We provided the dataset as argument with `dataset_repo_id=${HF_USER}/so100_test`.
2. We provided the policy with `policy=act_so100_real`. This loads configurations from [`lerobot/configs/policy/act_so100_real.yaml`](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/configs/policy/act_so100_real.yaml). Importantly, this policy uses 2 cameras as input `laptop`, `phone`.
3. We provided an environment as argument with `env=so100_real`. This loads configurations from [`lerobot/configs/env/so100_real.yaml`](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/configs/env/so100_real.yaml).
4. We provided `device=cuda` since we are training on a Nvidia GPU, but you can also use `device=mps` if you are using a Mac with Apple silicon, or `device=cpu` otherwise.
5. We provided `wandb.enable=true` to use [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for visualizing training plots. This is optional but if you use it, make sure you are logged in by running `wandb login`.

Training should take several hours. You will find checkpoints in `outputs/train/act_so100_test/checkpoints`.

### Evaluate your policy

You can use the `record` function from [`lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py) but with a policy checkpoint as input. For instance, run this command to record 10 evaluation episodes:
```bash
python lerobot/scripts/control_robot.py record \
  --robot-path lerobot/configs/robot/so100.yaml \
  --fps 30 \
  --repo-id ${HF_USER}/eval_act_so100_test \
  --tags so100 tutorial eval \
  --warmup-time-s 5 \
  --episode-time-s 40 \
  --reset-time-s 10 \
  --num-episodes 10 \
  -p outputs/train/act_so100_test/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model
```

As you can see, it's almost the same command as previously used to record your training dataset. Two things changed:
1. There is an additional `-p` argument which indicates the path to your policy checkpoint with  (e.g. `-p outputs/train/eval_so100_test/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model`). You can also use the model repository if you uploaded a model checkpoint to the hub (e.g. `-p ${HF_USER}/act_so100_test`).
2. The name of dataset begins by `eval` to reflect that you are running inference (e.g. `--repo-id ${HF_USER}/eval_act_so100_test`).
