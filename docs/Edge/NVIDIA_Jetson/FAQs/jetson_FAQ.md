#### Q7: I cannot use USB-A port, Ethernet port or no HDMI dispaly after flashing the device.
**A:** Please check file integrity (for instance, we provided the SHA256 cheksums), for some carrier boards (especially A60X series), make sure that the driver patch was successfully copied/applied to **Linux_for_tegra** directory. There are files that require **sudo** permission, and when you copy directories, make sure **-r** parameter is included in your command.

#### Q8: My system crashed/unable to boot/black screen/lost peripheral drivers after I execute "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" commands.
**A:** These issues can be concluded as **"Why can't I upgrade the system with apt upgrade on custom carrier boards?"** The short answer is: **Do not** run the apt upgrade command on **custom/third-party** carrier boards. Additionally, avoid running any scripts that include apt upgrade commands or using GUI updater tools in Ubuntu. Debian packages from the server do not account for the specific design of our custom boards, and forcing the upgrade can cause incompatibilities that may brick your device. This process is only compatible with the official devkit. To solve these issues, please follow our guide to reflash the JetPack.

#### Q9: How can I upgrade software packages if you told me that I cannot execute apt upgrade? Will there be security risks if I don't upgrade the software?
