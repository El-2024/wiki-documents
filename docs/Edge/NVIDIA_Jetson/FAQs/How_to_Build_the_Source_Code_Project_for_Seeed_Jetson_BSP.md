**This wiki demonstrates how to obtain the BSP source code for Seeed's Jetson products, organize it into a complete BSP source package, and compile/flash it onto Jetson devices.**

## 1. Prepare workspace

This guide takes **L4T 36.4.3** as an example to demonstrate how to build the source code project, compile it, and flash it to the Jetson device. The same process applies to other versionsâ€”simply **replace the version number in the subsequent example commands with your desired build version**.

Before getting start, you need to prepare an **Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 PC host**.

If you're unsure about the relationship between L4T versions and JetPack versions, you can refer to this link:
https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-archive.
<div align="center"><img width ="700" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/L4T-jetpack.png
"/></div>

Search for the specific **L4T (Linux for Tegra)** release you want to compile, e.g.:
<div align="center"><img width ="700" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/google_L4T.jpg"/></div>

<!-- After clicking on the web, download and prepare the sample root file system, NVIDIA's official BSP and the toolchain used for cross-compilation, as shown below.
<div align="center"><img width ="700" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/download-BSP-rootfs-toolchain.png"/></div> -->

Extract the official BSP from NVIDIA, and you will get a directory named `Linux_for_Tegra`. Then, extract the root file system archive into the official `Linux_for_Tegra` directory:

```bash
tar xf Jetson_Linux_r36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2
sudo tar xpf Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_r36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2 -C Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/
```

Sync the source code for compiling. Replace the argument after `-t` with **the L4T version you want**:

```bash
cd Linux_for_Tegra/source/
./source_sync.sh -t jetson_36.4.3
```

Exit to the root directory of your workspace. Git clone the source code of your desired branch to your local machine using the following command
(replace `-b <branch name>` with the target branch):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-lfs
cd ../..
mkdir -p github/Linux_for_Tegra
git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Linux_for_Tegra.git -b r36.4.3 --depth=1 github/Linux_for_Tegra
```

The BSP source code for Seeed's Jetson is available in **this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Linux_for_Tegra/tree/main).**
You can check the different branches to find your desired L4T version, as each branch corresponds to a different L4T release.
<div align="center"><img width ="700" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/github_L4T.jpg"/></div>

Then overwrite the original source code:

```bash
cp -r github/Linux_for_Tegra/* Linux_for_Tegra/
```

Apply necessary changes to rootfs:

```bash
cd Linux_for_Tegra
sudo ./apply_binaries.sh
```

Install dependencies on your PC:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install sshpass
sudo apt-get install abootimg
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils
sudo apt-get install qemu-user-static
```

prepare work for kernel build:

```bash
mkdir -p l4t-gcc
tar xf aarch64--glibc--stable-2022.08-1.tar.bz2 -C ./l4t-gcc
export ARCH=arm64
export CROSS_COMPILE=/your_path/l4t-gcc/aarch64--glibc--stable-2022.08-1/bin/aarch64-buildroot-linux-gnu-
```

Compile and build kernel:

```bash
cd source
./nvbuild.sh
```

Install new kernel dtbs and drivers:

```bash
./do_copy.sh
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/your_path/Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/
./nvbuild.sh -i
```

:::tip
For JetPack 5, since the file paths are different, you need to modify the `-p` parameter to:
`-p "-c bootloader/t186ref/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml"`
:::

For **Jetpack 6**, flashing the device(take **recomputer-orin-j401** for example):

```bash
sudo ./tools/kernel_flash/l4t_initrd_flash.sh \
--external-device nvme0n1p1 -c tools/kernel_flash/flash_l4t_t234_nvme.xml \
-p "-c bootloader/generic/cfg/flash_t234_qspi.xml"  --showlogs \
--network usb0 recomputer-orin-j401 internal
```

Replace `recomputer-orin-j401` with the name of the device you are using. You need to provide a valid `device name` as a parameter, which you can find by checking the .conf filenames in the root directory of `Linux_for_Tegra`. The prefix of these filenames corresponds to the valid `device name` parameters.
<div align="center"><img width ="700" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/FAQ/device_name.png
"/></div>

Therefore, the available device name parameters for **L4T 36.4.3** are as follows. The **j40** and **j30** series use the same configuration file:

- recomputer-industrial-orin-j201 (recomputer-industrial-orin-j40/j30 also uses this `device name` as the parameter.)
- recomputer-orin-j401
- reserver-agx-orin-j501x
- reserver-agx-orin-j501x-gmsl
- reserver-industrial-orin-j401
- recomputer-orin-j40mini
- recomputer-orin-robotics-j401
- recomputer-orin-super-j401
