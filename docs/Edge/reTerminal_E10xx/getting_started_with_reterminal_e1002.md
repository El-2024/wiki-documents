Depending on your operating system, you may need to install USB drivers to ensure proper communication with your reTerminal E1002:

- **For Mac computers**: Download and install the CH34X driver from [WCH official website](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH34XSER_MAC_ZIP.html)

- **For Windows computers**: 
  - Windows 11 systems typically include the driver by default
  - For Windows 10 and earlier versions, you may need to download and install the CH341 driver from [WCH official website](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html)

- **For Linux systems**: Most modern Linux distributions include the necessary drivers by default

**Step 4.** Update the firmware to ensure your device is running the latest version:

1. Connect your reTerminal E1002 to your computer using the USB-C cable

2. Power on the device using the power switch on the back

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/134.jpg" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/22.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Getting Started with SenseCraft HMI

After pairing your device with the SenseCraft platform as described in the previous section, you'll be ready to create your first dashboard. For detailed instructions on using each feature, please refer to the corresponding Wiki pages:

- [SenseCraft HMI Overview](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_overview)
- [AI Generator Guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_ai_generation)
- [Gallery Usage Guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_gallery)
- [Canvas Design Tools](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_canvas)
- [RSS Feed Configuration](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_rss)
- [Web Content Display](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_web)

Once you've created and saved your dashboard in the SenseCraft platform, simply click "Deploy to Device," select your paired reTerminal E1002, and your custom content will be wirelessly transmitted to the device. The ePaper display will update to show your dashboard, and you can use the navigation buttons to switch between multiple pages if you've created them.

## Operating the Device

### Refresh Button

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/137.jpg" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The refresh button at the top of the device serves several functions:

- **Single Press**: Manually refreshes the display and checks for new content from the SenseCraft platform. The buzzer will beep once to confirm the action. This button is also commonly used to wake up the device. You can use this button to wake up a device when it has gone to sleep and a dashboard refresh command is usually not immediately available to the device.

- **Long Press** (future functionality): Will activate voice input mode.

### Navigation Buttons

The left and right buttons allow you to navigate between multiple pages if your dashboard contains more than one page:

- **Left Button**: Navigate to the previous page

- **Right Button**: Navigate to the next page

### Network Reset

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/138.jpg" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If you need to connect to a different Wi-Fi network:

**Step 1.** Press and hold both navigation buttons (left and right) simultaneously for 2 seconds.

**Step 2.** The device will enter Wi-Fi configuration mode, and you can follow the [Network Setup](#network-setup) steps again to connect to a new network.

### LED Indicators

- **Red LED**:
  - Off: Fully charged or not charging
  - Always on: charging

- **Green LED**:
  - On for 30 seconds at boot: Device is powering on

### Battery Operation

When operating on battery power:

- The device will automatically enter low-power mode between refreshes

- Battery life depends on refresh frequency (typically 3-month on a full charge with default settings)

- The device will display a low battery icon in the top-right corner when the battery level is below 20%

### Expansion Pins

The reTerminal E1002 features an 8-pin expansion header (J2) that provides connectivity options for adding external sensors, modules, or other hardware to extend the functionality of your device. This expansion header exposes several ESP32-S3 GPIO pins and communication interfaces, making it a versatile connection point for your DIY projects.

#### Expansion Header Pinout

The 8-pin expansion header (J2) has the following pinout:

## Device Placement

The reTerminal E1002 comes with a 3D-printed support stand accessory that allows you to position the device upright for optimal viewing:

**Step 1.** Locate the 3D-printed support stand included in the package.

**Step 2.** Position the support stand against the designated mounting area on the bottom back of the reTerminal E1002 where the embedded nuts are located.

**Step 3.** Use a long screwdriver to secure the stand to the device by tightening the screws into the embedded nuts on the back of the reTerminal E1002.

**Step 4.** Once securely attached, place the reTerminal E1002 on a flat surface where the stand will support it in an upright position.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/139.jpg" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::note
The stand provides a fixed viewing angle and cannot be adjusted. This fixed positioning is designed to offer optimal visibility in most usage scenarios.

The stand allows the device to be placed on desks, countertops, or shelves, making it ideal for use as an information display, control panel, or digital photo frame in various environments.
