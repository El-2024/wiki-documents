### Getting Started with SenseCraft HMI

After pairing your device with the SenseCraft platform as described in the previous section, you'll be ready to create your first dashboard. For detailed instructions on using each feature, please refer to the corresponding Wiki pages:

- [SenseCraft HMI Overview](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_overview)
- [AI Generator Guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_ai_generation)
- [Gallery Usage Guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_gallery)
- [Canvas Design Tools](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_canvas)
- [RSS Feed Configuration](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_rss)
- [Web Content Display](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sensecraft_hmi_web)

Once you've created and saved your dashboard in the SenseCraft platform, simply click "Deploy to Device," select your paired reTerminal E1002, and your custom content will be wirelessly transmitted to the device. The ePaper display will update to show your dashboard, and you can use the navigation buttons to switch between multiple pages if you've created them.

## Operating the Device

### Refresh Button

The refresh button at the top of the device serves several functions:

- **Single Press**: Manually refreshes the display and checks for new content from the SenseCraft platform. The buzzer will beep once to confirm the action. This button is also commonly used to wake up the device. You can use this button to wake up a device when it has gone to sleep and a dashboard refresh command is usually not immediately available to the device.

- **Long Press** (future functionality): Will activate voice input mode.

### Navigation Buttons

The left and right buttons allow you to navigate between multiple pages if your dashboard contains more than one page:

- **Left Button**: Navigate to the previous page

- **Right Button**: Navigate to the next page

### Network Reset

If you need to connect to a different Wi-Fi network:

**Step 1.** Press and hold both navigation buttons (left and right) simultaneously for 2 seconds.

**Step 2.** The device will enter Wi-Fi configuration mode, and you can follow the "Network Setup" steps again to connect to a new network.

### LED Indicators

- **Red LED**:
  - Off: Fully charged or not charging
  - Always on: charging

- **Green LED**:
  - On for 30 seconds at boot: Device is powering on

### Battery Operation

When operating on battery power:

- The device will automatically enter low-power mode between refreshes

- Battery life depends on refresh frequency (typically several weeks on a full charge with default settings)

- The device will display a low battery icon in the top-right corner when the battery level is below 20%

### Expansion Pins

The reTerminal E1002 features an 8-pin expansion header that provides:
- Power (VDD)
- Ground (GND)
- I2C interface
- GPIO pins

These expansion pins allow you to connect additional sensors, actuators, or other hardware to extend the functionality of your device. They can be accessed for custom development projects when you need to add hardware capabilities beyond those built into the reTerminal E1002.

## Device Placement

The reTerminal E1002 comes with a support stand accessory that allows you to position the device upright for optimal viewing:

**Step 1.** Locate the support stand included in the package.

**Step 2.** Insert the stand into the designated slot at the bottom back of the reTerminal E1002.

**Step 3.** Adjust the angle of the stand to achieve your preferred viewing position.

The stand allows the device to be placed on desks, countertops, or shelves, making it ideal for use as an information display or digital photo frame in various environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: Device Won't Power On
