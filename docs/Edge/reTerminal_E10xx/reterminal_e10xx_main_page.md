# reTerminal E Series ePaper Display Overview

## Introduction

The reTerminal E Series ePaper Display represents Seeed Studio's family of ePaper display terminals designed for low-power information display applications. These devices combine the power efficiency of ePaper technology with wireless connectivity to create versatile displays for smart homes, retail environments, office spaces, and more.

Unlike traditional displays that consume power continuously, the reTerminal E Series ePaper Display only uses power when changing content, making them ideal for applications requiring extended battery life and always-on information display.
