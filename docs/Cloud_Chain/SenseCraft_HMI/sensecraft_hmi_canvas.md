# Using Canvas in SenseCraft HMI

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/141.jpg" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Introduction

The Canvas function in [SenseCraft HMI](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/hmi) is the most powerful and flexible feature of the platform, allowing you to create custom interfaces, dashboards, and data visualizations. With Canvas, you can design beautiful displays that combine static elements with dynamic data from various sources, including device sensors, weather information, stock data, and more.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through using the Canvas function to create professional displays for your Seeed devices. From basic shapes and text to real-time data widgets and pre-made templates, you'll learn everything you need to build customized interfaces that meet your specific needs.

This article will use the [reTerminal E1002](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_reterminal_e1002/) as an example to explain how to use this feature on the SenseCraft HMI platform.

## Getting Started with Canvas

### Accessing the Canvas Function

Step 1. Navigate to the SenseCraft HMI platform below.

<div class="get_one_now_container" style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <a class="get_one_now_item" href="https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/hmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            <strong><span><font color={'FFFFFF'} size={"4"}> SenseCraft HMI üñ±Ô∏è</font></span></strong>
    </a>
</div><br />

Step 2. Connect your device or select an already paired device to use.

Step 2. Drag the "Data" component to your desired position.

Step 3. With the component selected, click the **Data Settings** icon (it looks like a chain link) in the toolbar to open the configuration panel.

Step 4. In the **Data Settings** panel, configure your external data source:
   - **Remote Data URL**: Enter the full URL of the external API from which you want to fetch data.
   - **Data Key**: Specify the exact path to the data you want to display from the API's JSON response. Use dot notation for nested objects (e.g., `current.temp_c`) and numeric indexes for arrays.
   - **Precision**: For numerical data, set the number of decimal places you wish to display. The default is 2.
   - **Test**: Click this button to verify that the URL and Data Key are correct and that data can be fetched successfully.

   - Left panel with the channel name and slogan/description in a stylish black background

   - Right panel with "YouTube" label, subscriber count, and "Subscribers" text

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/126.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 7. Review the preview and note:

   - The template will replace all current elements on your canvas

   - All template elements will be given unique IDs to avoid conflicts

   - You can modify the template after applying it to the canvas

Step 8. Click "Apply to Canvas" to add the template to your workspace

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/127.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>


:::note
- The YouTube Channel Stats template requires internet access on your device to fetch channel data.

- YouTube Data API has quotas and rate limits that may affect usage.

- The template automatically retrieves the channel's slogan or description when available.

- For channels with a large number of subscribers, the count may be abbreviated (e.g., "1.2M" for 1,200,000).
