This board based on the latest SIMCOM SIM808 GSM/GPS module, it offers cellular GSM and GPRS data along with GPS technology for satellite navigation.

The board features ultra-low power consumption in sleep mode, giving the project incredibly long standby times. Furthermore there's an onboard battery charging circuit that can be used with LiPo batteries.

The GPS receiver is incredibly sensitive with 22 tracking and 66 acquisition channels, and also supports assisted-GPS (A-GPS) for indoor localisation. The board is controlled by AT command via UART and supports 3.3V and 5V logical level. It comes with a mini GPS and GSM antenna, however a battery is optional.

The board uses the 2G (not 3G or LTE) GSM networks.

### Getting Started with AT Command

The module is controlled by AT command via serial port, here we use Arduino as USB to serial tool. Upload the following code to Arduino and open the serial monitor. If you use other USB to serial tools, you can use [AT Command Tester](/AT_Command_Tester_Application) or [SSCOM32](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LoNet_808-Mini_GSM_GPRS_Plus_GPS_Breakout/res/Sscom32E.zip) to test AT commands.

```arduino
// this sketch is used for testing LoNet with Arduino

// Connect VIO to +5V
// Connect GND to Ground
// Connect RX (data into SIM808) to Digital 11
// Connect TX (data out from SIM808) to Digital 10

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial mySerial(10, 11); // RX, TX

void setup()
{
    // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
    Serial.begin(9600);
    mySerial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() // run over and over
{
    if (mySerial.available())
        Serial.write(mySerial.read());

    if (Serial.available())
    {
        while(Serial.available())
        {
            mySerial.write(Serial.read());
        }
        mySerial.println();
    }
}
```

#### Set Baud and Enable Charging Function

It is recommended to execute this process when first time to use the module. In the Serial Monitor columns of following tables, input of AT commands are in back, module returns values are in orange.

| Serial Monitor | Description |
