## Introduction 
BACnet IP (Building Automation and Control Network over IP) is a communication protocol designed for managing and automating building systems. It enables devices from different manufacturers to interoperate seamlessly over standard IP networks, enhancing system integration and flexibility. The primary advantages of BACnet IP in Building Management Systems (BMS) include improved scalability, easier installation and maintenance, and the ability to leverage existing network infrastructure. BACnet IP also supports real-time data exchange, facilitating better monitoring and control of building systems. This results in increased energy efficiency, reduced operational costs, and enhanced occupant comfort and safety.

## Getting Start

Before you start this project, you may need to prepare your hardware and software in advance as described here.

          </a></div></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>

### Software Preparation

We have prepared a [Getting started Guide on Node-RED](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-DM-Getting-Started-with-Node-Red/). It is recommended that you review this guide before proceeding to the wiki.

### YABE

Please go to this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yetanotherbacnetexplorer/) and download YABE (Yet Another BACnet Explorer). YABE is a versatile tool that allows you to simulate and explore BACnet devices, making it ideal for testing and development purposes. Once downloaded and installed on your Host PC, YABE will be used to simulate room temperature data, which we will then read and process using Node-RED on the reTerminal DM.

### Configure Ethernet settings for BACnet IP
Since your Device IP domain is different from your wireless settings, you may have to change the IP configuration manually. For that,

- **Step 01**: Run the following command:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

- **Step 02**: Then configure the Ethernet port settings according to your PLC/Device network domain and set priorities using the **metric** command. The lowest metric has the highest priority.

## Install BACnet node

1. **Open Node-RED:**
   Start Node-RED on your reTerminal. You can usually access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://<your-reTerminal-DM-ip>:1880`.

2. **Access Manage Palette:**
   In the top-right corner of the Node-RED interface, click on the three horizontal lines (menu) to open the main menu. From the drop-down menu, select "Manage palette."

3. **Install New Nodes:**
   In the "Manage palette" window, go to the "Install" tab.

4. **Search for the Package:**
   In the search box, type `node-red-contrib-bacnet-extended` to find the package.

5. **Install the Package:**
   Once you see `node-red-contrib-bacnet-extended` in the list of available nodes, click the "Install" button next to it. This will start the installation process.

6. **Wait for Installation to Complete:**
   The installation might take a few moments. Once it‚Äôs complete, you should see a confirmation message.

7. **Verify Installation:**
   After the installation is complete, the BACnet nodes will be available in the Node-RED palette. You can verify this by checking the list of nodes on the left sidebar of the Node-RED editor.

Now, you have successfully installed `node-red-contrib-bacnet-extended` and can start using it to integrate BACnet devices with your Node-RED flows.

## Start Room Temperature Controller Simulator 

Once you have installed YABE, navigate to the `add-on` folder and double-click `bacnet.Room.Simulator` to start it. 

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/nodered/room-simulator.PNG" /></center>

Once done, you need to start YABE.

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/nodered/Yabe-app.png" /></center>

Then, click on the `+` mark to add a device and enter the IP address of your PC's Ethernet port. Click on "Start."

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/nodered/YABE-config.PNG" /></center>

:::note
You might need to configure the Ethernet port IP address to ensure it is in the same network domain as both the reTerminal DM and your PC.
:::



After that, you should be able to see the device with the same device ID as the room temperature simulator.
