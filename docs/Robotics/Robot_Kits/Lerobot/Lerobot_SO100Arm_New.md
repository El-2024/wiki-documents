## 3D Printing Guide

:::caution
Following the official update of SO101, SO100 will no longer support it and the source files will be deleted as per the official, but the source files can still be found in our [Makerworld](https://makerworld.com/zh/models/908660). However, for users who have previously purchased SO100, the tutorials and installation methods remain compatible. The print of SO101 is fully compatible with the motor kit installation of SO100.
:::


### Step 1: Choose a printer

The STL files provided are ready to print on many FDM printers. Below are the tested and suggested settings though others may work.
- Material: PLA+ 
- Nozzle Diameter and Precision: 0.4mm nozzle diameter at 0.2mm layer height or 0.6mm nozzle at 0.4mm layer height.
- Infill Density: 15%  

### Step 2: Set up the printer

- Ensure that the printer is calibrated and the bed level is correctly set using the printer specific instructions.
- Clean the print bed, making sure it is free from dust, or grease. If cleaning the bed using water, or other liquid, dry the bed.
- If your printer recommends it, use a standard glue stick and apply a thin, even layer of glue across the print area of the bed. Avoid clumping or uneven application.
- Load the printer filament using printer specific instructions.
- Ensure the printer settings match the ones suggested above (most printers have multiple settings so choose the ones that most closely match).
- Set for supports everywhere but ignore slopes greater than 45 degrees to the horizontal.
- There should be no supports in the screw holes with horizontal axes.

### Step 3: Print the parts
All the parts for the leader or follower are for easy 3D printing already contained in a single file, correctly orientated for z upwards to minimize supports.

- For printer bed sizes of 220mmx220mm (such as the Ender), print these files:
  - [Follower](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/STL/SO101/Follower/Ender_Follower_SO101.stl)
  - [Leader](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/STL/SO101/Leader/Ender_Leader_SO101.stl)

- For printer bed sizes of 205mm x 250mm (such as the Prusa/Up):
  - [Follower](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/STL/SO101/Follower/Prusa_Follower_SO101.stl)
  - [Leader](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/STL/SO101/Leader/Prusa_Leader_SO101.stl)



## Install LeRobot

Environments such as pytorch and torchvision need to be installed based on your CUDA.
1. Install Miniconda:
For Jetson:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Or, For X86 Ubuntu 22.04:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
cd miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda init --all
```

2. Create and activate a fresh conda environment for lerobot

```bash
conda create -y -n lerobot python=3.10 && conda activate lerobot
```

3. Clone Lerobot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/lerobot.git ~/lerobot
```

4. When using miniconda, install ffmpeg in your environment:

```bash
conda install ffmpeg -c conda-forge
```

:::tip
This usually installs ffmpeg 7.X for your platform compiled with the libsvtav1 encoder. If libsvtav1 is not supported (check supported encoders with ffmpeg -encoders), you can:
- [On any platform] Explicitly install ffmpeg 7.X using:
```bash
conda install ffmpeg=7.1.1 -c conda-forge
```
- [On Linux only] Install ffmpeg build dependencies and compile ffmpeg from source with libsvtav1, and make sure you use the corresponding ffmpeg binary to your install with which ffmpeg.


:::

5. Install LeRobot with dependencies for the feetech motors:

```bash
cd ~/lerobot && pip install -e ".[feetech]"
```


For Jetson Jetpack devices (please make sure to install [Pytorch-gpu and Torchvision](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/reComputer-Jetson-for-Beginners/blob/main/3-Basic-Tools-and-Getting-Started/3.3-Pytorch-and-Tensorflow/README.md#installing-pytorch-on-recomputer-nvidia-jetson) from step 5 before executing this step):

```bash
conda install -y -c conda-forge "opencv>=4.10.0.84"  # Install OpenCV and other dependencies through conda, this step is only for Jetson Jetpack 6.0+
conda remove opencv   # Uninstall OpenCV 
pip3 install opencv-python==4.10.0.84  # Then install opencv-python via pip3
conda install -y -c conda-forge ffmpeg
conda uninstall numpy
pip3 install numpy==1.26.0  # This should match torchvision
```


6. Check Pytorch and Torchvision

Since installing the lerobot environment via pip will uninstall the original Pytorch and Torchvision and install the CPU versions of Pytorch and Torchvision, you need to perform a check in Python.

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

If the printed result is False, you need to reinstall Pytorch and Torchvision according to the [official website tutorial](https://pytorch.org/index.html).

If you are using a Jetson device, install Pytorch and Torchvision according to [this tutorial](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/reComputer-Jetson-for-Beginners/blob/main/3-Basic-Tools-and-Getting-Started/3.3-Pytorch-and-Tensorflow/README.md#installing-pytorch-on-recomputer-nvidia-jetson).


## Configure the motors

:::danger  
Due to official code and servo manufacturer firmware updates, users before June 30, 2025, please download the [Feetech official host computer software](https://gitee.com/ftservo/fddebug) (for Windows systems) first. Power on and connect all servos, select the corresponding `Port Number` -> `Baudrate 1000000` -> `Open` -> `Search`. After detecting all servos, click `Upgrade` -> `Online Detection` -> `Upgrade Firmware` to ensure the firmware version is updated from 3.9 to 3.10 to avoid subsequent issues.  
:::

:::note
If the servo cannot be recognized again after a failed firmware update, you can connect another detectable servo directly to the host computer, then perform a motor scan and firmware online detection. Keep the current window open, immediately disconnect the current servo, and connect the unrecognized servo instead. Click ‚Äã‚Äã"Online Upgrade"‚Äã‚Äã within 1 second. If it fails, you can retry multiple times.

<TabItem value="SO101" label="SO101">


The servo calibration and initialization process for SO-ARM101 is the same as that of SO-ARM100 in terms of both method and code. However, please note that the gear ratios for the first three joints of the SO-ARM101 Leader Arm differ from those of SO-ARM100, so it‚Äôs important to distinguish and calibrate them carefully.

To configure the motors designate one bus servo adapter and 6 motors for your leader arm, and similarly the other bus servo adapter and 6 motors for the follower arm. It's convenient to label them and write on each motor if it's for the follower F or for the leader L and it's ID from 1 to 6. We use **F1‚ÄìF6** to represent joints 1 to 6 of the **Follower Arm**, and **L1‚ÄìL6** to represent joints 1 to 6 of the **Leader Arm**. The corresponding servo model, joint assignments, and gear ratio details are as follows:

| Servo Model                            | Gear Ratio | Corresponding Joints         |
|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------|
| ST-3215-C044(7.4V)                            | 1:191      | L1                           |
| ST-3215-C001(7.4V)                       | 1:345      | L2                           |

| ST-3215-C046(7.4V)                           | 1:147      | L4‚ÄìL6                        |
| ST-3215-C001(7.4V) / C018(12V) / C047(12V)             | 1:345      | F1‚ÄìF6                        |

:::danger
You now should plug the 5V or 12V power supply to the motor bus. 5V for the STS3215 7.4V motors and 12V for the STS3215 12V motors. Note that the leader arm always uses the 7.4V motors, so watch out that you plug in the right power supply if you have 12V and 7.4V motors, otherwise you might burn your motors! Now, connect the motor bus to your computer via USB. Note that the USB doesn't provide any power, and both the power supply and USB have to be plugged in.

:::tip
Again, please make sure that the servo joint IDs and gear ratios strictly correspond to those of the SO-ARM101.
:::

***The following are the code calibration steps, please calibrate with the reference wiring servo in the picture above***

Find USB ports associated to your arms
To find the correct ports for each arm, run the utility script twice:

```bash
python -m lerobot.find_port
```

Example output:

```bash
Finding all available ports for the MotorBus.
['/dev/ttyACM0', '/dev/ttyACM1']
Remove the usb cable from your MotorsBus and press Enter when done.

[...Disconnect corresponding leader or follower arm and press Enter...]

The port of this MotorsBus is /dev/ttyACM1
Reconnect the USB cable.
```
:::tip
Remember to remove the usb, otherwise the interface will not be detected.
:::

Example output when identifying the leader arm's port (e.g., `/dev/tty.usbmodem575E0031751` on Mac, or possibly `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux):

Example output when identifying the follower arm's port (e.g., `/dev/tty.usbmodem575E0032081`, or possibly `/dev/ttyACM1` on Linux):

You might need to give access to the USB ports by running:

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1
```

**Configure your motors**

Connect the usb cable from your computer and the power supply to the follower arm‚Äôs controller board. Then, run the following command.

```bash
python -m lerobot.setup_motors \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem585A0076841  # <- paste here the port found at previous step
```

You should see the following instruction.

```bash
Connect the controller board to the 'gripper' motor only and press enter.
```

As instructed, plug the gripper‚Äôs motor. Make sure it‚Äôs the only motor connected to the board, and that the motor itself is not yet daisy-chained to any other motor. As you press [Enter], the script will automatically set the id and baudrate for that motor.

You should then see the following message:

```bash
'gripper' motor id set to 6
```

Followed by the next instruction:

```bash
Connect the controller board to the 'wrist_roll' motor only and press enter.
```

You can disconnect the 3-pin cable from the controller board, but you can leave it connected to the gripper motor on the other end, as it will already be in the right place. Now, plug in another 3-pin cable to the wrist roll motor and connect it to the controller board. As with the previous motor, make sure it is the only motor connected to the board and that the motor itself isn‚Äôt connected to any other one.

:::caution
Repeat the operation for each motor as instructed.
:::

Check your cabling at each step before pressing Enter. For instance, the power supply cable might disconnect as you manipulate the board.

When you are done, the script will simply finish, at which point the motors are ready to be used. You can now plug the 3-pin cable from each motor to the next one, and the cable from the first motor (the ‚Äòshoulder pan‚Äô with id=1) to the controller board, which can now be attached to the base of the arm.

Do the same steps for the leader arm.

```bash
python -m lerobot.setup_motors \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem575E0031751  # <- paste here the port found at previous step
```

- The dual-arm assembly process of SO-ARM101 is the same as that of SO-ARM100. The only differences are the addition of cable clips on SO-ARM101 and the different gear ratios of the joint servos on the Leader Arm. So both SO100 and SO101 can be installed by referring to the following content
- Before assembly, please check your motor model and reduction ratio again. If you have purchased SO100, you can ignore this step. If you have purchased SO101, please check the following table to distinguish F1 to F6 and L1 to L6.

:::danger
If you purchased the **SO101 Arm Kit Standard Edition**, all power supplies are 5V. If you purchased the **SO101 Arm Kit Pro Edition**, the Leader Arm should be calibrated and operated at every step using a 5V power supply, while the Follower Arm should be calibrated and operated at every step using a 12V power supply.

## Calibrate

:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::

:::danger
If you purchased the **SO101 Arm Kit Standard Edition**, all power supplies are 5V. If you purchased the **SO101 Arm Kit Pro Edition**, the Leader Arm should be calibrated and operated at every step using a 5V power supply, while the Follower Arm should be calibrated and operated at every step using a 12V power supply.
:::

Next, you need to connect the power supply and data cable to your SO-10x robot for calibration to ensure that the leader and follower arms have the same position values when they are in the same physical position. This calibration is essential because it allows a neural network trained on one SO-10x robot to work on another. If you need to recalibrate the robotic arm, delete the `~/lerobot/.cache/huggingface/calibration/so101` folder.

**Manual calibration of follower arm**

Please connect the interfaces of the 6 robot servos via a 3-pin cable and connect the chassis servo to the servo drive plate, then run the following command or API example to calibrate the robot arm:


***Interface permissions are given first***

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM*
```

***Then calibrate the follower arm***

```python
python -m lerobot.calibrate \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431551 \ # <- The port of your robot
    --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm # <- Give the robot a unique name
```

The video below shows how to perform the calibration. First you need to move the robot to the position where all joints are in the middle of their ranges. Then after pressing enter you have to move each joint through its full range of motion.

**Manual calibration of leader arm**

Do the same steps to calibrate the leader arm, run the following command or API example:

```python
python -m lerobot.calibrate \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431551 \ # <- The port of your robot
    --teleop.id=my_awesome_leader_arm # <- Give the robot a unique name
```

<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="900" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/22n6f5xH9Dk?si=2QTzn1CDbsSv6Y_H" title="youtube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


## Teleoperate

**Simple teleop**
Then you are ready to teleoperate your robot! Run this simple script (it won't connect and display the cameras):

Note that the id associated with a robot is used to store the calibration file. It‚Äôs important to use the same id when teleoperating, recording, and evaluating when using the same setup.

```bash
python -m lerobot.teleoperate \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431541 \
    --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431551 \
    --teleop.id=my_awesome_leader_arm
```

The teleoperate command will automatically:

1. Identify any missing calibrations and initiate the calibration procedure.
2. Connect the robot and teleop device and start teleoperation.

</div>



## Add cameras

:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::

To instantiate a camera, you need a camera identifier. This identifier might change if you reboot your computer or re-plug your camera, a behavior mostly dependant on your operating system.

To find the camera indices of the cameras plugged into your system, run the following script:

```python
python -m lerobot.find_cameras opencv # or realsense for Intel Realsense cameras
```

The terminal will print out the following information.

```markdown
--- Detected Cameras ---
Camera #0:
  Name: OpenCV Camera @ 0
  Type: OpenCV
  Id: 0
  Backend api: AVFOUNDATION
  Default stream profile:
    Format: 16.0
    Width: 1920
    Height: 1080
    Fps: 15.0
--------------------
(more cameras ...)
```

You can find the pictures taken by each camera in the `outputs/captured_images` directory.

:::warning
When using Intel RealSense cameras in , you could get this error: , this can be solved by running the same command with permissions. Note that using RealSense cameras in is unstable.macOSError finding RealSense cameras: failed to set power statesudomacOS.
:::


Then you will be able to display the cameras on your computer while you are teleoperating by running the following code. This is useful to prepare your setup before recording your first dataset.

```bash
python -m lerobot.teleoperate \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431541 \
    --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm \
    --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 30}}" \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431551 \
    --teleop.id=my_awesome_leader_arm \
    --display_data=true
```

If you have more cameras, you can change `--robot.cameras` to add cameras. You should note the format of the index_or_path, which is determined by the last digit of the camera ID output by `python -m lerobot.find_cameras opencv`.

For example, you want to add a side camera:
```bash
python -m lerobot.teleoperate \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431541 \
    --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm \
    --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 30}, side: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 1, width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 30}}" \ 
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431551 \
    --teleop.id=my_awesome_leader_arm \
    --display_data=true
```

</div>





## Record the dataset
:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::


Once you're familiar with teleoperation, you can record your first dataset with SO-10x.

If you want to use the Hugging Face hub features for uploading your dataset and you haven't previously done it, make sure you've logged in using a write-access token, which can be generated from the [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens):

```bash
huggingface-cli login --token ${HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN} --add-to-git-credential
```

Store your Hugging Face repository name in a variable to run these commands:

```bash
HF_USER=$(huggingface-cli whoami | head -n 1)
echo $HF_USER
```

Record 5 episodes and upload your dataset to the hub:

```bash
python -m lerobot.record \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem585A0076841 \
    --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm \
    --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 1920, height: 1080, fps: 30}}" \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431551 \
    --teleop.id=my_awesome_leader_arm \
    --display_data=true \
    --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/record-test \
    --dataset.num_episodes=5 \
    --dataset.single_task="Grab the black cube" \
    --dataset.push_to_hub=true \  # You can choose false if you want to save the data locally
    --dataset.episode_time_s=30 \    
    --dataset.reset_time_s=30 
```

You will see a lot of lines appearing like this one:
```bash
INFO 2024-08-10 15:02:58 ol_robot.py:219 dt:33.34 (30.0hz) dtRlead: 5.06 (197.5hz) dtWfoll: 0.25 (3963.7hz) dtRfoll: 6.22 (160.7hz) dtRlaptop: 32.57 (30.7hz) dtRphone: 33.84 (29.5hz)
```


**Parameter Explanations**
- episode-time-s: It represents the time for collecting data each time.
- reset-time-s: It is the preparation time between each data collection.
- num-episodes: It indicates how many groups of data are expected to be collected.
- push-to-hub: It determines whether to upload the data to the HuggingFace Hub. 

:::tip

- "If you want to save the data locally (`--dataset.push_to_hub=false`), replace `--dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/so101_test` with a custom local folder name, such as `--dataset.repo_id=seeed_123/so101_test`. It will then be stored in the system's home directory at `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot`."

- If you uploaded your dataset to the hub with `--dataset.push_to_hub=true`, you can [visualize your dataset online](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lerobot/visualize_dataset) by copy pasting your repo id given by:

- Press right arrow ‚Üí at any time during episode recording to early stop and go to resetting. Same during resetting, to early stop and to go to the next episode recording.

- Press left arrow ‚Üê at any time during episode recording or resetting to early stop, cancel the current episode, and re-record it.

- Press escape ESC at any time during episode recording to end the session early and go straight to video encoding and dataset uploading.

- Note: Checkpoints are automatically created during recording. If an issue occurs, you can resume by re-running the same command with `--resume=true`. To start recording from scratch, manually delete the dataset directory.

- Once you're comfortable with data recording, you can create a larger dataset for training. A good starting task is grasping an object at different locations and placing it in a bin. We suggest recording at least 50 episodes, with 10 episodes per location. Keep the cameras fixed and maintain consistent grasping behavior throughout the recordings. Also make sure the object you are manipulating is visible on the camera's. A good rule of thumb is you should be able to do the task yourself by only looking at the camera images.

- In the following sections, you‚Äôll train your neural network. After achieving reliable grasping performance, you can start introducing more variations during data collection, such as additional grasp locations, different grasping techniques, and altering camera positions.

- Avoid adding too much variation too quickly, as it may hinder your results.

- On Linux, if the left and right arrow keys and escape key don't have any effect during data recording, make sure you've set the $DISPLAY environment variable. See [pynput limitations](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html#linux).

## Visualize the dataset
:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::

```bash
echo ${HF_USER}/so101_test  
```

If you didn't upload with `--dataset.push_to_hub=false`, you can also visualize it locally with:

```bash
python -m lerobot.scripts.visualize_dataset_html \
  --repo-id ${HF_USER}/so101_test \
```

If you upload with `--dataset.push_to_hub=false`, you can also visualize it locally with:

```bash
python -m lerobot.scripts.visualize_dataset_html \
  --repo-id seeed_123/so101_test \
```
**Here, `seeed_123` is the custom `repo_id` name defined when collecting data.**

</div>


## Replay an episode
:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::

Now try to replay the first episode on your robot:

```bash
python -m lerobot.replay \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/tty.usbmodem58760431541 \
    --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm \
    --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/record-test \
    --dataset.episode=0 # choose the episode you want to replay
```

## Train a policy
:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::

To train a policy to control your robot, use the python -m lerobot.scripts.train script. A few arguments are required. Here is an example command:

```bash
python -m lerobot.scripts.train \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/so101_test \
  --policy.type=act \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/act_so101_test \
  --job_name=act_so101_test \
  --policy.device=cuda \
  --wandb.enable=true \
```

**If you want to train on a local dataset, make sure the `repo_id` matches the one used during data collection and add `--policy.push_to_hub=False`.**


Let's explain it:

1. We provided the dataset as argument with `--dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/so101_test`.
2. We provide the policy using `policy.type=act`, which will load the configuration from [`configuration_act.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/src/lerobot/policies/act/configuration_act.py). Importantly, this policy will automatically adapt to the number of motor states, motor actions and cameras of your robot (e.g. `laptop` and `phone`) which have been saved in your dataset.
3. We provided `policy.device=cuda` since we are training on a Nvidia GPU, but you could use `policy.device=mps` to train on Apple silicon.
5. We provided `wandb.enable=true` to use [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for visualizing training plots. This is optional but if you use it, make sure you are logged in by running `wandb login`.

Training should take several hours. You will find checkpoints in `outputs/train/act_so100_test/checkpoints`.

To resume training from a checkpoint, below is an example command to resume from last checkpoint of the `act_so101_test` policy:
```bash
python -m lerobot.scripts.train \
  --config_path=outputs/train/act_so101_test/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model/train_config.json \
  --resume=true
```

**Upload policy checkpoints**

Once training is done, upload the latest checkpoint with:

```bash
huggingface-cli upload ${HF_USER}/act_so101_test \
  outputs/train/act_so101_test/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model
```

You can also upload intermediate checkpoints with:

```bash
CKPT=010000
huggingface-cli upload ${HF_USER}/act_so101_test${CKPT} \
  outputs/train/act_so101_test/checkpoints/${CKPT}/pretrained_model
```

## Evaluate your policy
:::tip
The SO100 and SO101 codes are compatible. Users of SO100 can directly utilize SO101's parameters and code for operation.
:::

You can use the `record` function from [`lerobot/record.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/record.py) but with a policy checkpoint as input. For instance, run this command to record 10 evaluation episodes:

```bash
python -m lerobot.record  \
  --robot.type=so100_follower \
  --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM1 \
  --robot.cameras="{ up: {type: opencv, index_or_path: /dev/video10, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}, side: {type: intelrealsense, serial_number_or_name: 233522074606, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}}" \
  --robot.id=my_awesome_follower_arm \
  --display_data=false \
  --dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/eval_so100 \
  --dataset.single_task="Put lego brick into the transparent box" \
  --policy.path=${HF_USER}/my_policy
```

As you can see, it's almost the same command as previously used to record your training dataset. Two things changed:

1. There is an additional `--policy.path` argument which indicates the path to your policy checkpoint with  (e.g. `outputs/train/eval_act_so100_test/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model`). You can also use the model repository if you uploaded a model checkpoint to the hub (e.g. `${HF_USER}/act_so100_test`).
2. The name of dataset begins by `eval` to reflect that you are running inference (e.g. `${HF_USER}/eval_act_so100_test`).

- If you are following this documentation/tutorial, please git clone the recommended GitHub repository `https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/lerobot.git`. The repository recommended in this documentation is a verified stable version; the official Lerobot repository is continuously updated to the latest version, which may cause unforeseen issues such as different dataset versions, different commands, etc.

- If you encounter the following error, you need to check whether the robotic arm connected to the corresponding port is powered on and whether the bus servos have any loose or disconnected cables.
  ```bash
  ConnectionError: Read failed due to comunication eror on port /dev/ttyACM0 for group key Present_Position_Shoulder_pan_Shoulder_lift_elbow_flex_wrist_flex_wrist_roll_griper: [TxRxResult] There is no status packet!
  ```

- If you have repaired or replaced any parts of the robotic arm, please completely delete the `~/lerobot/.cache/huggingface/calibration/so100` folder and recalibrate the robotic arm.

- If the remote control functions normally but the remote control with Camera fails to display the image interface, you can find [here](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/pull/757/files)

- If you encounter libtiff issues during dataset remote operation, please update the libtiff version.
  ```bash
  conda install libtiff==4.5.0  #for Ubuntu 22.04 is libtiff==4.5.1
  ```

- After executing the [Lerobot Installation](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/lerobot_so100m/#install-lerobot), the GPU version of pytorch may be automatically uninstalled, so you need to manually install torch-gpu.

- For Jetson, please first install [Pytorch and Torchvsion](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/reComputer-Jetson-for-Beginners/blob/main/3-Basic-Tools-and-Getting-Started/3.3-Pytorch-and-Tensorflow/README.md#installing-pytorch-on-recomputer-nvidia-jetson) before executing `conda install -y -c conda-forge ffmpeg`, otherwise, when compiling torchvision, an ffmpeg version mismatch issue may occur.

- If the following problem occurs, it means that your computer does not support this video codec format. You need to modify line 134 in the file `lerobot/lerobot/common/datasets
/video_utils.py` by changing the value of `vcodec: str = "libsvtav1"` to `libx264` or `libopenh264`. Different computers may require different parameters, so you can try various options. [Issues 705](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/issues/705)
  
  ```bash
  [vost#0:0 @ 0x13207240] Unknown encoder 'libsvtav1' [vost#0:0 @ 0x13207240] Error selecting an encoder Error opening output file /home/han/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/lyhhan/so100_test/videos/chunk-000/observation.images.laptop/episode_000000.mp4. Error opening output files: Encoder not found
  ``` 

- Important!!! If during execution the servo's cable becomes loose, please restore the servo to its initial position and then reconnect the servo cable. You can also individually calibrate a servo using the [Servo Initialization Command](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/lerobot_so100m/#configure-the-motors), ensuring that only one cable is connected between the servo and the driver board during individual calibration. If you encounter
  ```bash
  Auto-correct calibration of motor 'wrist roll' by shifting value by 1 full turns, from '-270 < -312.451171875 < 270degrees' to'-270<-312.451171875 < 270 degrees'.
  ```
  or other errors during the robotic arm calibration process related to angles and exceeding limit values, this method is still applicable.

- Training 50 sets of ACT data on an 8G 3060 laptop takes approximately 6 hours, while on a 4090 or A100 computer, training 50 sets of data takes about 2‚Äì3 hours.

- During data collection, ensure that the camera's position, angle, and environmental lighting remain stable, and minimize capturing excessive unstable backgrounds and pedestrians; otherwise, significant environmental changes during deployment may cause the robotic arm to fail to grasp properly.

- Ensure that the `num-episodes` parameter in the data collection command is set to collect sufficient data, and do not manually pause midway. This is because the mean and variance of the data are calculated only after data collection is complete, which is necessary for training.

- If the program prompts that it cannot read the USB camera image data, please ensure that the USB camera is not connected to a hub. The USB camera must be directly connected to the device to ensure a fast image transmission rate.
