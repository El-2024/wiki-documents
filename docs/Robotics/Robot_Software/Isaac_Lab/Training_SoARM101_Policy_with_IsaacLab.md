## Introduction
This wiki introduces how to use Isaac Lab to train and test SO-ARM100/101 robotic arm policies with reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ“ŒPrerequisites
- An Ubuntu PC with Nvidia GPU

:::info
If you donâ€™t have CUDA drivers or Conda installed, please set them up first.
:::

## Getting Started

### ðŸš€ Step 1. Install Isaac Lab
NVIDIA Isaacâ„¢ Lab is an open-source unified framework for [robot learning](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/robot-learning/) that helps researchers and developers efficiently train robotic policies.

Run the following commands in the Ubuntu PC terminal:

```bash
# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n isaaclab python=3.10
conda activate isaaclab

# Install PyTorch (GPU version)
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Isaac Sim (with extensions)
pip install 'isaacsim[all,extscache]==4.5.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

# Clone IsaacLab repository
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git

# Install dependencies
sudo apt install cmake build-essential

# Initialize setup
cd IsaacLab
./isaaclab.sh --install
```

Run the following command to verify installation:

```bash
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/tutorials/00_sim/create_empty.py
```

If successful, an empty Isaac Sim window should appear.

</div>


### ðŸ¤– Step 2. Install isaac_so_arm101 Project

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
    This repository implements tasks for the SOâ€‘ARM100 and SOâ€‘ARM101 robots using Isaac Lab. It serves as the foundation for several tutorials in the LycheeAI Hub series Project: [SOâ€‘ARM101 Ã— Isaac Sim Ã— Isaac Lab](https://lycheeai-hub.com/project-so-arm101-x-isaac-sim-x-isaac-lab-tutorial-series).
</div>

Run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/MuammerBay/isaac_so_arm101.git
cd isaac_so_arm101

# Install project dependencies
python -m pip install -e source/SO_100

# Test environments
python scripts/list_envs.py
```

If the isaac_so_arm101 project is successfully installed, the terminal window will print the following log:

    <img width={900} 
    src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/isaaclab_rl/install.png" />
</div>

### ðŸŽ¯ Step 3. Start Training

Launch training with:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task SO-ARM100-Reach-v0
```

This will open an Isaac Sim window where you can observe the training process in real time. You can add the `--headless` parameter to the launch command to speed up the training process.

</div>

After training, the model weights will be saved under: 
`~/Documents/isaac_so_arm101/logs/rsl_rl/so_arm100_reach`

</div>

### ðŸ§ª Step 4. Test the Model

Test the trained model with:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task SO-ARM100-Reach-Play-v0
```

During testing, target positions are randomly generated within a defined range, and the trained model drives the robotic arm to reach those targets.
