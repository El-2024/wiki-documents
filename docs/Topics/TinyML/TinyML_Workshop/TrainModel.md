# Train and Deploy Your Own AI Model

## SenseCraft AI Platform

Seeed Studio [SenseCraft AI Platform](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/ai/#/model) is a browser-based AI Solution. 

It empowers users to effortlessly train and deploy their own models onto their edge devices, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience, allowing you to train and deploy your own models directly onto your edge devices with **just a few clicks**.

:::info
The core of it is an open source project and we have share it on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/ModelAssistant) and offer the [development method](/ModelAssistant_Introduce_Overview) as well.
:::

## Start Training the Model

We first go to the [SenseCraft AI Deployment Website](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/ai/#/device/local?time=1724577953974), then simply connect the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense to your PC via a data cable to instantly start using.

#### Step 1. Install XIAO ESP32S3 Sense expansion board

First, we need to properly connect the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense expansion board to the XIAO. Installing the expansion board is very simple, you just need to align the connector on the expansion board with the B2B connector on the XIAO ESP32S3, press it hard and hear a "click", the installation is complete.

#### Step 2. Connecting the XIAO to your PC

Connect the XIAO to your PC using a data cable with data transfer function.

#### Step 3. Go to the SenseCraft AI Platform page and connect the XIAO

Click the button below to go to the SenseCraft AI Platform homepage.

	<a class="get_one_now_item" href="https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/ai/#/home"><strong><span><font color={'FFFFFF'} size={"2"}>SenseCraft AI Platform</font></span></strong></a>
</div><br />


#### step 4. Start training the model

After entering the SenseCraft AI platform homepage, we first click `Training`, then select `Classification Type`, name your classes, and finally choose `XIAO ESP32S3 Sense`.


<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/trainingmodel/1.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then, based on your requirements for classification, refer to your class, and click `Hold to Record`.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/trainingmodel/2.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>


This time, I chose the requirement for gesture recognition to classify "12345."

:::tip

Capture pictures: Each one over 10 images will be fine, more are better.

:::


After data collection is complete, we select `XIAO ESP32S3 Sense` in the Training section and click `Start Training`.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/trainingmodel/4.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

After training is complete, we can see our training results through a real-time preview.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/trainingmodel/5.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

#### step 5. Deploy the model

After previewing and confirming that the trained model is fine, we select `Training Records`, then choose the recently trained model (named “ClassTrain” and “XIAO”) and click `Deploy to device`.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/trainingmodel/6.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

After successfully deploying to the device, you will see the results directly:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/trainingmodel/7.gif" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

You have successfully trained your first ML model!

If you have more time, you can try using [the `Output` operation you've learned before](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/sscma/#2-sensecraft-triggers---do-a-simple-feedback-action).

# ToDo
- [ ] Train and deploy models using the SenseCraft AI platform.
- [ ] Setup a Trigger and **Control LED** for your trained models with SenseCraft AI Platform.

## (Optional) Federate: Transmit data wide away

In this step, we are trying to transmit our data from XIAO ESP32S3 Sense to a remote device, using Wi-Fi and MQTT, helping us see its deployment remotely.

### Step 1. Setup MQTT on a device and test

As example, we are using NVIDIA Jetson reComputer J4012 for it. It supports MQTT broker installation and the most important thing is that it offers 100 TOPS AI Power, for us applying LLM locally.

The SenseCraft AI Platform is supporting Wi-Fi and MQTT connection.

First we need to install the MQTT broker(Mosquitto) and then try to setup the MQTT server.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
```

and get the Mosquitto installation done on the reComputer(Linux).

Then run the commend:

```
sudo service mosquitto start
```

to start it.

Later we can run this commend:

```
sudo service mosquitto status
```

to see whether it is been activited:

:::info
Testing:

For creating/subcribing a topic:

```
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "LED"
```

For sending/publishing some data:

```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "LED" -m "1"
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "LED" -m "test"
```

Getting the results and it seems all good:

:::

And the `localhost` is `192.168.66.184`(as reComputer):

### Step 3. Configure XIAO ESP32S3 Sense on SenseCraft AI Platform

On the SenseCraft AI Platform, you can refer to the "Configuration" page:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/tinyml-topic/xiao_mqtt_1.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::info
- SSID: (Wi-Fi name same as your MQTT device)
- Password: (Wi-Fi passowrd as your MQTT device)
- Encryption: AUTO
- MQTT: Yes
- Host: (IP address from your MQTT device) 
- Port: 1883

In this exaple, the MQTT device is the reComputer like above.
:::

### Step 3. Receive data from XIAO ESP32S3 Sense and Display

In the receive part, you can install a client with command:

```
pip install python-sscma
```

This is an integrated client for the [sscma_micro](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/sscma_micro), which is a microcontroller at server for the [SSCMA](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SSCMA) models.

And then receive the data using:

```
sscma.cli client --broker mqtt.broker.com --device device_id 
```

:::info
In this case, `mqtt.broker.com` is 192.168.66.184, `device_id` is from XIAO ESP32S3 Sense on SenseCraft AI Platform.

### Step 4. (comming soon)Federate multiple XIAOs on one page

### Step 5. (comming soon)Enable LLM to automatically watch images from XIAO
